        "Course Summary": "Theatre is a unique form of art which combines visual arts with literature and sends messages to many people through actors’ bodies. This seminar aims to be an introduction to theatre and performance studies. In 2024, we will focus on “cross-dressing” and “gender” in the plays of William Shakespeare (1564-1616), one of the most popular English dramatists of all time. Shakespeare’s heroines sometimes disguise as men; among those characters include Viola in Twelfth Night and Rosalind in As You Like It. In Shakespeare’s England, women did not appear on the commercial stage due to social norms based on biblical teachings (Actresses appeared on stage in England after the Restoration in 1660). It was boy actors that played these characters. Cross-gender casting is also employed in contemporary performances of his plays. We will examine dramatic effects of cross-dressing on stage from the viewpoints of early modern historical and cultural contexts, and will discuss how Shakespeare’s plays help us understand the world we live in.\n\nThis seminar reads Shakespeare’s plays which explore the issue of cross-dressing. In the reading of plays and other materials, students need to give a presentation about assigned scenes. In workshops, they are expected to act and direct selected scenes that interest them from our seminar. Using audiovisual materials, we will discuss what it means for a play to be performed on stage through actor’s bodies and voices. Through this process, students will find a research topic, pose a research question, make a research plan and give a presentation about their research. They need to submit a final report based on the final presentation. Students who took this seminar this spring need to submit a report which further develops their research at the end of fall semester. \n",

        "Course Summary": "Mission: In Search of Future of Organizations\n\nWe live in various \"organizations\" such as schools, companies, and club activities. Although the form and purpose may differ, the concept of \"organization\" is an extremely familiar and important theme for all of us. Organization theory is an academic discipline that explores how people collaborate together in society to achieve common goals, regardless of whether they are for-profit or non-profit.\n\nOur mission is in search of future of organizations. Organizations increasingly rely on technologies to operate, organize, and innovate in this AI/big data era. Also, radical changes in the society such as issues related to diversity, inclusion, equity, sustainability, environment, and governance have huge impacts on how we (should) manage organizations. We collectively explore the future of organizations, which is a frontier of management studies and practice. We approach these themes from various perspectives and methods including (but not limited to) qualitative case studies and data science, and project works with business partners in the real world.\n\nResearch Projects in 2024\nOur lab is seriously exploring the frontiers of the future of organizations. \n- Digital future city project (collaboration with Tsuyama city in Okayama)\n- New ways of working in the age of XR (collaboration with Dynabook Inc.)\n- Leaders and Narrative\n- Startup CEO Strategy\n- Workcation\n- Great place to work (work engagement and work environment)\n\nThese themes are being explored by companies, practitioners, and researchers around the world on an ongoing basis, and no one has the right answers yet. We would like to explore with you essential and future-oriented organizational management issues that are worthy of being addressed by SFC students from the future.\n\nFor the reference, research topics in past years include: \n- Human capital management & Digital organizations\n- Organizations and careers from the perspective of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n- The growth of startups and angel investors\n- Freelance work and regional revitalization\n- web 3 and DAO\n\nTo explore the above themes, we implement a multifaceted approach. We will establish multiple project teams and collaborate with companies and external researchers to conduct both practical problem-solving projects and research activities that explore the frontiers of knowledge. Please check the details of specific ongoing research projects at the information session of our lab.In conducting research, we will use qualitative research (case study) approaches based on interviews and fieldwork, as well as quantitative research approaches based on survey research and experiments, according to the preferences of each project member.\n\nBased on these general themes and approaches, students will be encouraged to explore specific projects in a creative and student-driven manner. In particular, as this is a new lab, starting in April 2021, you will be creating the history of the study group. We hope to create the best possible study group with members who share our ambitious attempt to launch a new study group.\n\n",

In other words, an interest in communication inevitably leads to an interest in \"place\" and \"place-making. In this Kenkyukai, we are conducting practical research on the \"movement (mobility)\" of people, the nature of \"places\" where people gather, and \"place-making\" from the perspective of communication and media studies.\n",

        "Research Seminar Theme": "Algorithmic Design",
        "Course Summary": "The term \"Algorithm\" may give the impression that a computer is being used to automatically generate architecture. Indeed, programming is an essential skill in ADL. An algorithm is a procedure for solving a certain problem, so as long as the procedure is clear, it is not so difficult to translate it into a computer program and generate architecture in an algorithmic way. No, a programming language is a kind of language, and like English, it takes a certain amount of time to be able to program at will. But anyone can learn to program if they put in the time.\n\nWhat is really difficult is the opposite. In other words, it is much more difficult to view architecture in an algorithmic manner than to create architecture in an algorithmic manner. To see architecture in an algorithmic way means to explore the laws that lie behind seemingly different architectural groups. The search for the laws of architecture is something that many people have been doing since the birth of architectural science. It is not unique to ADL. However, the architectural design process is still often a black box. Therefore, many students who aspire to become architects tend to rely on their sense, experience, and intuition to design architecture.\n\nAt ADL, we also do algorithmic architecture, but we spend a lot of time looking at architecture in an algorithmic way. This is because if we can \"see various architectural groups as different manifestations = forms, generated from the same laws = forms,\" we can reverse the process and \"create various architectural groups = forms, using the same laws = forms.\n\nIn this way, ADL explores the computability of architecture by writing down every design process related to architecture into a computer algorithm. By doing so thoroughly, the computational \"un-\"possibilities of architecture and the city will emerge, i.e., what only humans can do and what designers should do.\n\nFor more specific activities, please see the following two lecture videos.\nAlgorithmic Design - Growing Architecture Like Growing Plants-(00:12:16)\nFramework of algorithmic design(01:29:47)\n\nIf you are at all interested in ADL after watching these videos, please come to our study group.\nEven if you are a beginner in architectural design or have no programming experience, you are welcome. If you are interested but concerned, please talk to a current ADL member first. We welcome motivated students who are willing to explore the computational (un)possibilities of architecture with us.\n",

We construct them through the process of \"negotiating\" the prevailing values in a larger whole (family, community, society, networks, etc.) of which we are part. How we live is constantly subject to changes alongside changes taking place in our physical and social environment. \nHowever, the changes in our behaviors may not necessarily alter a consistency in our way of living. This consistency manifests in how we try to minimize deviation from our routines, mitigate disruption to what and whom we have come to value, and concede gains to reduce \"losses.\" What we do, how we do it, and how we narrate what we do are not only reflections of our living. They are also the very \"expressions\" of the social and cultural to which we belong.\n\nResearch Tools and Basics: Sociology of Knowledge, Sociology of Politics, Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Economics, Case Studies, On-site Fieldwork, and Narrative Analysis. \n\nAreas of Study: Poverty, Education, Health, Disabilities, Human Security, Development issues, Natural Disasters, and behaviors in everyday life under various conditions. \n\nField Sites: Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Dinh Province,), Laos (Vientiane), Japan (Suyama, Shizuoka, Coastal regions in the North and others)\n\n",

        "Research Seminar Theme": "Searching for the Fusion and Dialogue between Academic Disciplines and Regional Studies",
        "Course Summary": "After the end of the Cold War, it became possible to proceed the real regional studies and the regional studies has been done actively in the academic society, because now we can visit many areas where we could not visit easily during the Cold War period and the ideology and bias have been already declined. However, the position of regional studies has never secured its academic position in the academic society. One of the reasons is that many regional researchers claim that their areas are special and unique; and the regional studies tend to remain unilateral information dissemination. Certainly, the more you study a certain area, the clearer the distinctiveness of the area become, so it is natural that such a tendency has been strengthen. However, it will end with self-satisfaction of the local researchers, and we cannot expect the development of regional studies.\n\nTherefore, this seminar will try to apply regional studies to more general academic context seeking dialogue and fusion of regional studies and academic disciplines. To give an example, in the case of that you choose regional conflict as the research theme, it would be needed study whole problems such as history, political problems, economics, religion, ethnic problem, social problems, geopolitical problems and so on, in the area, because the reasons of conflicts are really complicated. In addition, trying to generalize by comparing with other cases or regions, applying some disciplines, making general theories and so on would be also important. I would like to stress not to complete regional research by regional research alone, but make it available in a wider academic context, enable dialogue with experts from other regions and researchers of other disciplines, and make academic contributions.\n\nFor this aim, we will study general theories or discussions by reading books, and hear and discuss about each students’ research. All students must participate to the reading, make presentation and write term paper or graduate thesis on individual research. And we have guest speaker and discussions every semester. And we have seminer camp bystudent's preference.\n\nHirose's regional field is the former USSR, so I can make give the good comments on the regional studies on the former USSR or Yugoslavia, however all students who want to study everywhere are welcome.\n",

        "Research Seminar Theme": "Cross-dressing and Gender in Shakespeare’s Plays",
        "Course Summary": "Theatre is a unique form of art which combines visual arts with literature and sends messages to many people through actors’ bodies. This seminar aims to be an introduction to theatre and performance studies. In 2024, we will focus on “cross-dressing” and “gender” in the plays of William Shakespeare (1564-1616), one of the most popular English dramatists of all time. Shakespeare’s heroines sometimes disguise as men; among those characters include Viola in Twelfth Night and Rosalind in As You Like It. In Shakespeare’s England, women did not appear on the commercial stage due to social norms based on biblical teachings (Actresses appeared on stage in England after the Restoration in 1660). It was boy actors that played these characters. Cross-gender casting is also employed in contemporary performances of his plays. We will examine dramatic effects of cross-dressing on stage from the viewpoints of early modern historical and cultural contexts, and will discuss how Shakespeare’s plays help us understand the world we live in.\n\nThis seminar reads Shakespeare’s plays which explore the issue of cross-dressing. In the reading of plays and other materials, students need to give a presentation about assigned scenes. In workshops, they are expected to act and direct selected scenes that interest them from our seminar. Using audiovisual materials, we will discuss what it means for a play to be performed on stage through actor’s bodies and voices. Through this process, students will find a research topic, pose a research question, make a research plan and give a presentation about their research. They need to submit a final report based on the final presentation. Students who took this seminar this spring need to submit a report which further develops their research at the end of fall semester. \n",

        "Research Seminar Theme": "China Studies and International Relations（CSIR）",
        "Course Summary": "The international order is currently undergoing a major transformation. Perceptions of values and interests shared by the international community are changing, and the rules of the game, such as norms and institutions of the international community, are becoming unstable. Because Japanese society has enjoyed peace and prosperity within the existing international order, it is necessary to be sensitive to these changes, calmly analyze the current situation, formulate countermeasures, and disseminate and implement them.\n\nChina, the subject of our seminar's research, is a major actor driving changes in the international order. China is a huge player that is no longer allowed to rest on its laurels and play with arbitrary images of itself. The increase in China's national power, accompanied by rapid economic growth, has changed the distribution of power in the international community and has had a profound impact on the dynamics of international politics.\n\nThe purpose of our seminar is to try to understand the characteristics of the mechanisms of Chinese politics and the social context that gives rise to them, and to deepen our understanding of contemporary Chinese political diplomacy. Furthermore, our seminar will provide insights into \"how to deal with China\" and clues for the future of international politics.\n\nOur seminar will address another important research question. We will try to understand authoritarian politics. Authoritarianism is on the rise and democracy is in retreat. In the past, authoritarian politics was always viewed as unstable, while liberal democratic politics was seen as a necessary condition for a nation's economic development and stability. China, however, presents a different reality from this view. Why has Chinese politics maintained one-party rule? Why has Chinese society accepted one-party rule? Through the study of China, we should be able to obtain clues for understanding the politics of authoritarian states, which account for more than half of the world's population, and international politics, in which authoritarian states are rapidly expanding their influence.\n\nIn our seminar, we will (1) deepen our understanding of contemporary Chinese political diplomacy and (2) obtain clues to understanding authoritarian states. We will discuss contemporary Chinese politics and comparative political science literature materials to build the intellectual foundation necessary for a systematic understanding of Chinese politics, authoritarian politics, and international politics.\n\nOur seminar is a place to provide the intellectual training necessary to analyze and disseminate knowledge and systematic understanding of Chinese politics, authoritarian politics, and international politics, which is necessary for Japanese society and for you to play an active role in the international community, using Chinese politics and diplomacy as the subject matter.\n",

Data Driven means to make decisions and take actions based on data. In today's data-driven society, more quantitative and rational ways of thinking are required instead of the conventional qualitative decision-making. In light of this social trend, we are researching how to discover, solve, and implement problems using analytical methods that utilize data. Concretely speaking, we use geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze and map geographic data to discover problems in cities and regions, such as the environment, disaster prevention, transportation, tourism, welfare, and agriculture, to understand the causes of problems and their relationship to the people living there, to propose solutions for an ultra-smart society, and to provide policy support. We also propose solutions for an ultra-smart society and provide policy support. We are a research group that can discover problems, devise solutions, and implement them, which is a characteristic of SFC.\n",

        "Research Seminar Theme": "Algorithmic Design",
        "Course Summary": "The term \"Algorithm\" may give the impression that a computer is being used to automatically generate architecture. Indeed, programming is an essential skill in ADL. An algorithm is a procedure for solving a certain problem, so as long as the procedure is clear, it is not so difficult to translate it into a computer program and generate architecture in an algorithmic way. No, a programming language is a kind of language, and like English, it takes a certain amount of time to be able to program at will. But anyone can learn to program if they put in the time.\n\nWhat is really difficult is the opposite. In other words, it is much more difficult to view architecture in an algorithmic manner than to create architecture in an algorithmic manner. To see architecture in an algorithmic way means to explore the laws that lie behind seemingly different architectural groups. The search for the laws of architecture is something that many people have been doing since the birth of architectural science. It is not unique to ADL. However, the architectural design process is still often a black box. Therefore, many students who aspire to become architects tend to rely on their sense, experience, and intuition to design architecture.\n\nAt ADL, we also do algorithmic architecture, but we spend a lot of time looking at architecture in an algorithmic way. This is because if we can \"see various architectural groups as different manifestations = forms, generated from the same laws = forms,\" we can reverse the process and \"create various architectural groups = forms, using the same laws = forms.\n\nIn this way, ADL explores the computability of architecture by writing down every design process related to architecture into a computer algorithm. By doing so thoroughly, the computational \"un-\"possibilities of architecture and the city will emerge, i.e., what only humans can do and what designers should do.\n\nFor more specific activities, please see the following two lecture videos.\nAlgorithmic Design - Growing Architecture Like Growing Plants-(00:12:16)\nFramework of algorithmic design(01:29:47)\n\nIf you are at all interested in ADL after watching these videos, please come to our study group.\nEven if you are a beginner in architectural design or have no programming experience, you are welcome. If you are interested but concerned, please talk to a current ADL member first. We welcome motivated students who are willing to explore the computational (un)possibilities of architecture with us.\n",

We construct them through the process of \"negotiating\" the prevailing values in a larger whole (family, community, society, networks, etc.) of which we are part. How we live is constantly subject to changes alongside changes taking place in our physical and social environment. \nHowever, the changes in our behaviors may not necessarily alter a consistency in our way of living. This consistency manifests in how we try to minimize deviation from our routines, mitigate disruption to what and whom we have come to value, and concede gains to reduce \"losses.\" What we do, how we do it, and how we narrate what we do are not only reflections of our living. They are also the very \"expressions\" of the social and cultural to which we belong.\n\nResearch Tools and Basics: Sociology of Knowledge, Sociology of Politics, Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Economics, Case Studies, On-site Fieldwork, and Narrative Analysis. \n\nAreas of Study: Poverty, Education, Health, Disabilities, Human Security, Development issues, Natural Disasters, and behaviors in everyday life under various conditions. \n\nField Sites: Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Dinh Province,), Laos (Vientiane), Japan (Suyama, Shizuoka, Coastal regions in the North and others)\n\n",

        "Research Seminar Theme": "Cross-dressing and Gender in Shakespeare’s Plays",
        "Course Summary": "Theatre is a unique form of art which combines visual arts with literature and sends messages to many people through actors’ bodies. This seminar aims to be an introduction to theatre and performance studies. In 2024, we will focus on “cross-dressing” and “gender” in the plays of William Shakespeare (1564-1616), one of the most popular English dramatists of all time. Shakespeare’s heroines sometimes disguise as men; among those characters include Viola in Twelfth Night and Rosalind in As You Like It. In Shakespeare’s England, women did not appear on the commercial stage due to social norms based on biblical teachings (Actresses appeared on stage in England after the Restoration in 1660). It was boy actors that played these characters. Cross-gender casting is also employed in contemporary performances of his plays. We will examine dramatic effects of cross-dressing on stage from the viewpoints of early modern historical and cultural contexts, and will discuss how Shakespeare’s plays help us understand the world we live in.\n\nThis seminar reads Shakespeare’s plays which explore the issue of cross-dressing. In the reading of plays and other materials, students need to give a presentation about assigned scenes. In workshops, they are expected to act and direct selected scenes that interest them from our seminar. Using audiovisual materials, we will discuss what it means for a play to be performed on stage through actor’s bodies and voices. Through this process, students will find a research topic, pose a research question, make a research plan and give a presentation about their research. They need to submit a final report based on the final presentation. Students who took this seminar this spring need to submit a report which further develops their research at the end of fall semester. \n",

How should working and living be combined to make mobility and energy consumption become more sustainable? And what are the opportunities in creating urban areas based on social equity and resilience, in a volatile world characterized by digital disruption, migration and demographic shifts?” (The Industrious City, 2021, Lars Müller Publisher). \n",

With conventional computers, we can only manipulate closed information within computers, and with the current Web, we can only access information within computers around the world, but in the near future, a large number of sensors that reflect real-world information will be connected to computers around the world.\nIn the near future, however, as a large number of sensors reflecting real-world information are connected to computers around the world, it will become possible for anyone, anytime, anywhere to access real-world information from the entire world.\nThe fact that such \"worldwide programming\" has become possible is the most significant event since the beginning of human history, and is a major step toward the realization of a truly ubiquitous computing environment.\n\n",

        "Course Summary": "After the end of the Cold War, it became possible to proceed the real regional studies and the regional studies has been done actively in the academic society, because now we can visit many areas where we could not visit easily during the Cold War period and the ideology and bias have been already declined. However, the position of regional studies has never secured its academic position in the academic society. One of the reasons is that many regional researchers claim that their areas are special and unique; and the regional studies tend to remain unilateral information dissemination. Certainly, the more you study a certain area, the clearer the distinctiveness of the area become, so it is natural that such a tendency has been strengthen. However, it will end with self-satisfaction of the local researchers, and we cannot expect the development of regional studies.\n\nTherefore, this seminar will try to apply regional studies to more general academic context seeking dialogue and fusion of regional studies and academic disciplines. To give an example, in the case of that you choose regional conflict as the research theme, it would be needed study whole problems such as history, political problems, economics, religion, ethnic problem, social problems, geopolitical problems and so on, in the area, because the reasons of conflicts are really complicated. In addition, trying to generalize by comparing with other cases or regions, applying some disciplines, making general theories and so on would be also important. I would like to stress not to complete regional research by regional research alone, but make it available in a wider academic context, enable dialogue with experts from other regions and researchers of other disciplines, and make academic contributions.\n\nFor this aim, we will study general theories or discussions by reading books, and hear and discuss about each students’ research. All students must participate to the reading, make presentation and write term paper or graduate thesis on individual research. And we have guest speaker and discussions every semester. And we have seminer camp bystudent's preference.\n\nHirose's regional field is the former USSR, so I can make give the good comments on the regional studies on the former USSR or Yugoslavia, however all students who want to study everywhere are welcome.\n",

        "Course Summary": "About NeuroMusic Lab\nOur daily lives are overflowing with music. But when asked, 'What is music?', how many people in this world can insightfully discern its truth based on scientific knowledge? Music exists in our everyday life as if it's a given. However, we still do not know much about music. The main theme of the NeuroMusic Lab is to unravel the 'unknowns' of music and scientifically approach its essence. \nIn recent years, with the dramatic advancements in neurosciences, the way music is processed in the human brain and body, and the mechanisms behind it, have gradually been elucidated. Among the findings, what is particularly intriguing is that the music we casually enjoy is deeply connected to the very essence of human beings, including our culture, evolution, development, sociability, creativity, perception, cognition, movement, memory, emotions, and learning. Why are our human brains and bodies equipped with the ability to be moved by music, to find solace in it, to dance, sing, perform, and enjoy sounds? Unraveling this from a neuroscience perspective is nothing less than an exploration of human nature. 'Neurosciences and Music: NeuroMusic' is a field of study that investigates how musical information is processed in the human brain and nervous system, and how it creates rich and unique mental states, exploring its origins and principles. NeuroMusic is an exciting scientific research field that promises to approach the essence and origins of humanity.\nThe purpose of this Kenkyukai is to unravel the origins and principles of the musicality of humans, focusing on the Neurosciences and Music (NeuroMusic) as its theme. Those who are curious about what music truly is and are interested in pioneering the field of music science are encouraged to knock on the door of this Kenkyukai. \n",

        "Course Summary": "Faced with a declining birthrate and an aging and shrinking population, Japan is also facing a shortage of people to support the local community. The number of nuclear families is increasing like never before, and more and more people are facing challenges such as child-rearing, nursing care, withdrawal, deprivation, and social isolation in the absence of anyone to help them. In addition, government welfare workers are finding it difficult to locate people with these challenges because of the weakening of ties in the community. In order to improve this situation as much as possible, it is necessary to encourage local residents to take an active role in the community as supporters of community support. Although the current situation has been reported in the media, there are few opportunities to take on such roles or to experience the management of community activities.\n\nthis class provides an opportunity for participants to experience the role of a community support leader in the Shonan area, including the area around SFC, in cooperation and collaboration with residents' groups and government agencies. Through this opportunity, participants will gain an understanding of policy implementation and the actual operation of community activities, and will be able to formulate and implement specific measures in the future.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This class aims to develop an environment for learning foreign languages - especially Chinese - against the backdrop of the increase in remote classes due to the expansion of Covid-19 infection, and the demand for digitalization of teaching materials is increasing in foreign language education as well. What is required of digital teaching materials in the future is the creation of an individually optimized learning environment in which each learner can proceed with learning according to his/her own level of proficiency and understanding, rather than one that is uniformly applied to all learners.\nIn addition, second language education in Japan to date has focused on grammar translation and reading, with emphasis on vocabulary and grammar acquisition, and even if students earn credits, they often fail to reach a level where they can use the foreign language. In recent years, teaching methods aimed at enhancing learners' communicative competence have been tested, particularly in English and Japanese language education. We will consider how these findings can be applied to second language education, together with the direct teaching method, which is a characteristic of SFC's foreign language education.\nWith these concerns in mind, this class will proceed with the development of new teaching materials in accordance with SFC's curriculum, focusing on the following four points.\n\n(1) Investigation and research on learning strategies\n(2) Critical examination of existing teaching methods and materials\n(3) Development of teaching materials\n(4) Evaluation of teaching materials\n",

Sociolinguistics is a field that attempts to elucidate language in terms of its relationship with society, and its research targets range from familiar linguistic phenomena to language variation, multilingual use, language inheritance, language policy, language services, and more.\n\nMy own research topics that I have worked on/am working on include language policy for ethnic minorities, language evaluation attitudes, language use attitudes, attitudes toward the use of nominal terms for women, language services in Nagano Prefecture, and strategies for \"refusal\" in Chinese. In addition, the acquisition of sociolinguistic competence has become one of the most important topics in foreign language education. Therefore, this study group will also treat research on Chinese language education as one important issue.\n\nThe workshop will operate in the following sequence\n(1) Students will read and critically analyze the literature related to the theme that they (or their team) will address in their project.\n(2) Divide into projects, formulate themes, and derive hypotheses.\n(3) Design and conduct effective research to substantiate hypotheses.\n(4) Summarize the results of the investigation and report the findings.\n\nHere are some examples of projects addressed in this class:\n\nPragmatic studies of Chinese language\nResearch on multilingual coexistence in neighboring municipalities\nStudies on Chinese language education/acquisition\nResearch on language policy in China\nResearch on intercultural communication\n",

It is also true that there are many problems created by the current architecture of typical information systems, such as the fragmentation of communities. \nIn this research, we will conduct research and development on a new information system architecture that is different from the typical individual-oriented architecture of \"sensing personal big data, analyzing big data, and providing information optimized for the individual,\" always looking more than 10 years into the future.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Faced with a declining birthrate and an aging and shrinking population, Japan is also facing a shortage of people to support the local community. The number of nuclear families is increasing like never before, and more and more people are facing challenges such as child-rearing, nursing care, withdrawal, deprivation, and social isolation in the absence of anyone to help them. In addition, government welfare workers are finding it difficult to locate people with these challenges because of the weakening of ties in the community. In order to improve this situation as much as possible, it is necessary to encourage local residents to take an active role in the community as supporters of community support. Although the current situation has been reported in the media, there are few opportunities to take on such roles or to experience the management of community activities.\n\nthis class provides an opportunity for participants to experience the role of a community support leader in the Shonan area, including the area around SFC, in cooperation and collaboration with residents' groups and government agencies. Through this opportunity, participants will gain an understanding of policy implementation and the actual operation of community activities, and will be able to formulate and implement specific measures in the future.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This class aims to develop an environment for learning foreign languages - especially Chinese - against the backdrop of the increase in remote classes due to the expansion of Covid-19 infection, and the demand for digitalization of teaching materials is increasing in foreign language education as well. What is required of digital teaching materials in the future is the creation of an individually optimized learning environment in which each learner can proceed with learning according to his/her own level of proficiency and understanding, rather than one that is uniformly applied to all learners.\nIn addition, second language education in Japan to date has focused on grammar translation and reading, with emphasis on vocabulary and grammar acquisition, and even if students earn credits, they often fail to reach a level where they can use the foreign language. In recent years, teaching methods aimed at enhancing learners' communicative competence have been tested, particularly in English and Japanese language education. We will consider how these findings can be applied to second language education, together with the direct teaching method, which is a characteristic of SFC's foreign language education.\nWith these concerns in mind, this class will proceed with the development of new teaching materials in accordance with SFC's curriculum, focusing on the following four points.\n\n(1) Investigation and research on learning strategies\n(2) Critical examination of existing teaching methods and materials\n(3) Development of teaching materials\n(4) Evaluation of teaching materials\n",

Sociolinguistics is a field that attempts to elucidate language in terms of its relationship with society, and its research targets range from familiar linguistic phenomena to language variation, multilingual use, language inheritance, language policy, language services, and more.\n\nMy own research topics that I have worked on/am working on include language policy for ethnic minorities, language evaluation attitudes, language use attitudes, attitudes toward the use of nominal terms for women, language services in Nagano Prefecture, and strategies for \"refusal\" in Chinese. In addition, the acquisition of sociolinguistic competence has become one of the most important topics in foreign language education. Therefore, this study group will also treat research on Chinese language education as one important issue.\n\nThe workshop will operate in the following sequence\n(1) Students will read and critically analyze the literature related to the theme that they (or their team) will address in their project.\n(2) Divide into projects, formulate themes, and derive hypotheses.\n(3) Design and conduct effective research to substantiate hypotheses.\n(4) Summarize the results of the investigation and report the findings.\n\nHere are some examples of projects addressed in this class:\n\nPragmatic studies of Chinese language\nResearch on multilingual coexistence in neighboring municipalities\nStudies on Chinese language education/acquisition\nResearch on language policy in China\nResearch on intercultural communication\n",

However, the explosive amount of information produced by ICT/AI systems, for example, can lead to information overload in our daily lives, and the provision of individually optimized information (e.g., AI-based personal optimization of news articles provided on social networking sites) can distort the information we come into contact with and affect our thinking. It is also true that there are many problems created by the current architecture of typical information systems, such as the fragmentation of communities. \nIn this research, we will conduct research and development on a new information system architecture that is different from the typical individual-oriented architecture of \"sensing personal big data, analyzing big data, and providing information optimized for the individual,\" always looking more than 10 years into the future.\n",

The main theme of the NeuroMusic Lab is to unravel the 'unknowns' of music and scientifically approach its essence. \nIn recent years, with the dramatic advancements in neurosciences, the way music is processed in the human brain and body, and the mechanisms behind it, have gradually been elucidated. Among the findings, what is particularly intriguing is that the music we casually enjoy is deeply connected to the very essence of human beings, including our culture, evolution, development, sociability, creativity, perception, cognition, movement, memory, emotions, and learning. Why are our human brains and bodies equipped with the ability to be moved by music, to find solace in it, to dance, sing, perform, and enjoy sounds? Unraveling this from a neuroscience perspective is nothing less than an exploration of human nature. 'Neurosciences and Music: NeuroMusic' is a field of study that investigates how musical information is processed in the human brain and nervous system, and how it creates rich and unique mental states, exploring its origins and principles. NeuroMusic is an exciting scientific research field that promises to approach the essence and origins of humanity.\nThe purpose of this Kenkyukai is to unravel the origins and principles of the musicality of humans, focusing on the Neurosciences and Music (NeuroMusic) as its theme. Those who are curious about what music truly is and are interested in pioneering the field of music science are encouraged to knock on the door of this Kenkyukai. \n",

For this reason, we study not only major model organisms such as bacteria and rats, but also organisms that have not been studied very much in the past, such as slime molds, ants, and spiders. We welcome proposals for new target organisms with interesting phenomena.\n\nOur research approach combines both experimental and computational (wet and dry) methods. Specifically, we combine experimental processing such as field sampling, culturing, nucleic acid extraction, and genome engineering with informatics processing such as a simulation, genome analysis, sequence analysis, and image analysis.\n\nKeywords: synthetic biology, genome biology, behavioral ecology, molecular biology, molecular ecology, systems biology, bioinformatics \n",

However, the explosive amount of information produced by ICT/AI systems, for example, can lead to information overload in our daily lives, and the provision of individually optimized information (e.g., AI-based personal optimization of news articles provided on social networking sites) can distort the information we come into contact with and affect our thinking. It is also true that there are many problems created by the current architecture of typical information systems, such as the fragmentation of communities. \nIn this research, we will conduct research and development on a new information system architecture that is different from the typical individual-oriented architecture of \"sensing personal big data, analyzing big data, and providing information optimized for the individual,\" always looking more than 10 years into the future.\n",

In such a case, clinical education does not aim to increase the accuracy from 95% to 100%. Instead, its purpose is to accompany those learners who may appear to be part of the 5% that are left behind and provide them with support, giving voice to their unique learning experiences that cannot be generalized.\nwe refer to the act of carefully listening to learners' voices as \"clinical practice.\" Our aim is to accompany individuals throughout their learning journey, observe their progress, and explore the profound significance of continuous learning.\n\n",

        "Course Summary": "Faced with a declining birthrate and an aging and shrinking population, Japan is also facing a shortage of people to support the local community. The number of nuclear families is increasing like never before, and more and more people are facing challenges such as child-rearing, nursing care, withdrawal, deprivation, and social isolation in the absence of anyone to help them. In addition, government welfare workers are finding it difficult to locate people with these challenges because of the weakening of ties in the community. In order to improve this situation as much as possible, it is necessary to encourage local residents to take an active role in the community as supporters of community support. Although the current situation has been reported in the media, there are few opportunities to take on such roles or to experience the management of community activities.\n\nthis class provides an opportunity for participants to experience the role of a community support leader in the Shonan area, including the area around SFC, in cooperation and collaboration with residents' groups and government agencies. Through this opportunity, participants will gain an understanding of policy implementation and the actual operation of community activities, and will be able to formulate and implement specific measures in the future.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This class aims to develop an environment for learning foreign languages - especially Chinese - against the backdrop of the increase in remote classes due to the expansion of Covid-19 infection, and the demand for digitalization of teaching materials is increasing in foreign language education as well. What is required of digital teaching materials in the future is the creation of an individually optimized learning environment in which each learner can proceed with learning according to his/her own level of proficiency and understanding, rather than one that is uniformly applied to all learners.\nIn addition, second language education in Japan to date has focused on grammar translation and reading, with emphasis on vocabulary and grammar acquisition, and even if students earn credits, they often fail to reach a level where they can use the foreign language. In recent years, teaching methods aimed at enhancing learners' communicative competence have been tested, particularly in English and Japanese language education. We will consider how these findings can be applied to second language education, together with the direct teaching method, which is a characteristic of SFC's foreign language education.\nWith these concerns in mind, this class will proceed with the development of new teaching materials in accordance with SFC's curriculum, focusing on the following four points.\n\n(1) Investigation and research on learning strategies\n(2) Critical examination of existing teaching methods and materials\n(3) Development of teaching materials\n(4) Evaluation of teaching materials\n",

Sociolinguistics is a field that attempts to elucidate language in terms of its relationship with society, and its research targets range from familiar linguistic phenomena to language variation, multilingual use, language inheritance, language policy, language services, and more.\n\nMy own research topics that I have worked on/am working on include language policy for ethnic minorities, language evaluation attitudes, language use attitudes, attitudes toward the use of nominal terms for women, language services in Nagano Prefecture, and strategies for \"refusal\" in Chinese. In addition, the acquisition of sociolinguistic competence has become one of the most important topics in foreign language education. Therefore, this study group will also treat research on Chinese language education as one important issue.\n\nThe workshop will operate in the following sequence\n(1) Students will read and critically analyze the literature related to the theme that they (or their team) will address in their project.\n(2) Divide into projects, formulate themes, and derive hypotheses.\n(3) Design and conduct effective research to substantiate hypotheses.\n(4) Summarize the results of the investigation and report the findings.\n\nHere are some examples of projects addressed in this class:\n\nPragmatic studies of Chinese language\nResearch on multilingual coexistence in neighboring municipalities\nStudies on Chinese language education/acquisition\nResearch on language policy in China\nResearch on intercultural communication\n",

However, the explosive amount of information produced by ICT/AI systems, for example, can lead to information overload in our daily lives, and the provision of individually optimized information (e.g., AI-based personal optimization of news articles provided on social networking sites) can distort the information we come into contact with and affect our thinking. It is also true that there are many problems created by the current architecture of typical information systems, such as the fragmentation of communities. \nIn this research, we will conduct research and development on a new information system architecture that is different from the typical individual-oriented architecture of \"sensing personal big data, analyzing big data, and providing information optimized for the individual,\" always looking more than 10 years into the future.\n",

But when asked, 'What is music?', how many people in this world can insightfully discern its truth based on scientific knowledge? Music exists in our everyday life as if it's a given. However, we still do not know much about music. The main theme of the NeuroMusic Lab is to unravel the 'unknowns' of music and scientifically approach its essence. \nIn recent years, with the dramatic advancements in neurosciences, the way music is processed in the human brain and body, and the mechanisms behind it, have gradually been elucidated. Among the findings, what is particularly intriguing is that the music we casually enjoy is deeply connected to the very essence of human beings, including our culture, evolution, development, sociability, creativity, perception, cognition, movement, memory, emotions, and learning. Why are our human brains and bodies equipped with the ability to be moved by music, to find solace in it, to dance, sing, perform, and enjoy sounds? Unraveling this from a neuroscience perspective is nothing less than an exploration of human nature. 'Neurosciences and Music: NeuroMusic' is a field of study that investigates how musical information is processed in the human brain and nervous system, and how it creates rich and unique mental states, exploring its origins and principles. NeuroMusic is an exciting scientific research field that promises to approach the essence and origins of humanity.\nThe purpose of this Kenkyukai is to unravel the origins and principles of the musicality of humans, focusing on the Neurosciences and Music (NeuroMusic) as its theme. Those who are curious about what music truly is and are interested in pioneering the field of music science are encouraged to knock on the door of this Kenkyukai. \n",

However, the system itself has not been visualized in an easy-to-understand form, nor have methods and value criteria been established to determine what is to be preserved in the local landscape. Careful investigation, analysis, examination, and discussion are necessary to understand the local landscape.\nKamiyama is known for the beauty of its mountainous rural landscape of terraced rice paddies, terraced fields, and farmland along the Ayukuro River, but with plans to attract satellite offices of IT companies and a private technical college, rapid changes in the local landscape are expected. Currently, the town is considering formulating its first landscape plan.\nIn this project, with the cooperation of the Kamiyama Tsunagu Public Corporation, we will stay in Kamiyama to conduct a landscape survey of the area and prepare basic data for the study of the landscape plan. Through the survey, the participants will also learn fieldwork methods.\n",

It would be beneficial to have a basic understanding of the theories of second language acquisition (SLA). We will have guest speakers' lectures during this summer seminar. \nBefore the start of the seminar, each participant should prepare themselves by reading all the assigned articles. We will assign readings to seminar participants one week before the start of the seminar. Participants are expected to familiarise themselves with those articles so they can actively contribute to discussions in the seminar. \nAs a final project, students will design a pilot study, identifying relevant background literature and appropriate methods for the collection of data. They will present the above on the last day of the seminar. \n",

Therefore, we will prepare for brain information analysis and ask you to submit a simple preliminary assignment based on that preparation (please submit it by the end of August 2024). In this project, we will first learn about the basics of brain information analysis through lectures and materials. Next, we will apply what we have learned to brain data to promote understanding, and then present to each other.

Specifically, in accordance with the book's methodology, the participants will define organizational and individual achievement goals, create an immunity map against them and develop a plan to examine stereotypes behind the hidden motives. In doing so, the project will be in the form of a camp, with emphasis on creating a space where the group can live together and easily disclose themselves. Through these activities, we will identify areas where we believe there is \"room for change\" in organizations and individuals.\n",

However, there were not enough opportunities to comprehensively learn about the details of brain information analysis, from the basics to practice. Therefore, we will prepare for brain information analysis and ask you to submit a simple preliminary assignment based on that preparation (please submit it by the end of August 2024). In this project, we will first learn about the basics of brain information analysis through lectures and materials. Next, we will apply what we have learned to brain data to promote understanding, and then present to each other. Finally, we will summarize what we learned on the web as a final assignment (please submit it by the end of September 2024).\n",

        "Course Summary": "In a sudden disaster such as a major earthquake, a large number of injured and sick people may occur at the same time, and the survivors are forced to decide what the best option is in a situation where there is no best option. In fact, when drills simulating these situations are conducted at schools and other facilities, it has been observed that the disaster response capabilities of individual participants as well as the team strength itself improve with each repeated drill.\nThis suggests that even if individual disaster response skills, such as how to protect oneself at a moment's notice and how to deal with injured and sick people, are high, maximum performance cannot be achieved unless the team functions as a team. Organizations that have been trained for aircraft accidents and medical accidents, which are less frequent than major earthquakes, value this team's capability.\nIn this lecture course, we will consider what a functioning team is, based on the knowledge of aviation safety, which is always based on safety and deals with situations as a team. The knowledge gained will be appropriately applied to the teams that you belong and will form the basis for building a safety culture.\n",

Video sketches that introduce the German language to students through everyday situations at SFC form the core of the class content. After the one year of intensive 1 and 2 courses (basic 1 and 2 courses are equivalent to the intensive 1 course), students will be able to express their opinions and talk about their daily lives in German. Furthermore, at the intensive course 3 level, the setting of the sketches will move on to the German-speaking region. Topics of regionality and local culture are covered in the videos, allowing students to learn expressions and strategies that are important for communication in German. After completing intensive course 3, students can further improve their German skills through the skill and contents courses. Students are also encouraged to participate in the overseas language program. Further opportunities for overseas study include a one-year exchange program organized by the university as well as scholarship opportunities for short-term fieldwork. Steadily continuing to study German based on an enjoyable and fulfilling program will enable students to acquire practical German skills that can be used in the real world.\n",

        "Course Summary": "The main aim of the German courses at SFC is for students to acquire the skills necessary to talk about themselves in German. Video sketches that introduce the German language to students through everyday situations at SFC form the core of the class content. After the one year of intensive 1 and 2 courses (basic 1 and 2 courses are equivalent to the intensive 1 course), students will be able to express their opinions and talk about their daily lives in German. Furthermore, at the intensive course 3 level, the setting of the sketches will move on to the German-speaking region. Topics of regionality and local culture are covered in the videos, allowing students to learn expressions and strategies that are important for communication in German. After completing intensive course 3, students can further improve their German skills through the skill and contents courses. Students are also encouraged to participate in the overseas language program. Further opportunities for overseas study include a one-year exchange program organized by the university as well as scholarship opportunities for short-term fieldwork. Steadily continuing to study German based on an enjoyable and fulfilling program will enable students to acquire practical German skills that can be used in the real world.\n",

Furthermore, at the intensive course 3 level, the setting of the sketches will move on to the German-speaking region. Topics of regionality and local culture are covered in the videos, allowing students to learn expressions and strategies that are important for communication in German. After completing intensive course 3, students can further improve their German skills through the skill and contents courses. Students are also encouraged to participate in the German overseas language program. Further opportunities for overseas study include a one-year exchange program organized by the university as well as scholarship opportunities for short-term fieldwork. Steadily continuing to study German based on an enjoyable and fulfilling program will enable students to acquire practical German skills that can be used in the real world.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This course is designed to help students acquire through various activities an in-depth knowledge of citizenship within intercultural situations and specifically French-speaking cultures.\n\nThe world is heading towards a multicultural society. This trend exerts a direct or indirect influence not only on big cities and cyberspace, but also on local life. In order to better understand the situation abroad, to enrich individual lives, to satisfy various needs, to think and make decisions on our own, and to realize the dreams and hopes of ourselves and society, we must understand the ongoing transformation of society and citizens and face changes in values.\n\nThe main purpose of studying foreign languages at university is to deepen our understanding of different lifestyles, social issues, language, historical facts, and thought through fieldwork and hermeneutic approaches. In recent years, not only the humanities but also the natural and applied sciences such as life history research and space archaeology have achieved remarkable results. It provides a fresh understanding of the origins and history of consciousness, language, gender, and religion. Christian asymmetric thinking (science, capitalism, globalism) is at the root of issues that are directly linked to the global environment (East and West, the light and conflict of civilizations, and the reality of modern society). In this course, we will work on these issues based on discussions in the French-speaking world. This activity is a big intellectual adventure, and this course aims to be a bridge for that. \n\nIntercultural competences are not a simple complement in language and culture learning, and still less in learning itself. Through language activities, you acquire profound skills of critical thinking about differences and conflicts among views of life and death or among values, while exploiting your own experience on language learning and various alterities. From the perspective of research on people involved (“study of party”), this course helps students to understand in depth “citizenship” and “social majority”, and to develop self-reliance on language use in social life and face-to-face dialogue.\n",

While accuracy is certainly important, it is necessary, in some cases, to sort out the information that needs to be interpreted and transmitted. In order to achieve this, it is indispensable, not only to have effective listening skills, but also to enrich your vocabulary in advance.\n\tBy contrast, translation requires researching important documents without haste, helping readers to understand better by adding explanatory notes where needed. All of this is necessary to achieve excellent translation qualities. \n\tThus, interpretation and translation are distinct operations. This course, however, plans somewhat ambitiously to develop both skills at the same time.\n\tNote that translations made by students will be posted on Facebook. \n",

First, read the text carefully and savor the powerful and humorous words.\n\n",

In this version, language mediation activities are first classified into three categories: (1) text mediation, (2) concept mediation and (3) communication mediation.\n\nIn this course, the language activity covering all of (1) to (3) will be particularly focused on infographics on various social situations presented by the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas (INE), as well as graphs, diagrams and charts containing information on various social, economic, business management, etc. in Spanish-speaking countries, which will be read and presented as targeted mediation activities to communicate to others in a clear way.\n\nIn this course, the students will first learn what the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (MCER) is and what the teaching guidelines Plan curricular del Instituto Cervantes (PCIC), which reflect its principles in Spanish language teaching, are. They will also understand that linguistic activities include receptive, productive, interactive, and mediated activities, and how the CEFR and PCIC regard mediated activities within these categories. Specifically, they will learn the theoretical foundations, including how mediating activity is defined in Spanish Language learning. \n\nThe second half of the lecture focuses on practical exercises, and one of the goals is to be able to create an infographic about the thesis they are working on and explain it in Spanish.\n\n",

We will watch video series\ntogether to learn common phrases and expressions in context, then answer Q&A, and conduct discussions online. There are some phrases that have embedded meaning as well as literal meaning. For example, what does it mean by ‘Get out of here!’ when the speaker had the smiley yet surprised\nexpression on his face when he said it? Do you really need to get out of the room? Or did the speaker mean something else? These acts are called ‘indirect speech acts’ and students will learn by experiencing them and other types of discourse techniques via role plays. The focus will be placed on\nlearning by ‘speech act’ (such as ‘apology’ and ‘sarcasm’) but other patterns of pragmatic markers will be covered such as discourse markers, y’know within conversation.\nStudents will also study our original films (several skits made by English speaking SFC students) and compare their own skits with the model interactions. After learning useful expressions and phrases within context, students will be expected to develop their own scripts, and make their own movies in a group, utilizing what they learned in class. Attention should be paid to not only linguistic but also paralinguistic features such as tones as well as non-verbal ones (facial expressions, gestures, gazing, and body language). They are expected to learn autonomously online and in class interactively engaging with the instructor and the classmates in English.\n",

For example, students choose a controversial issue on English education (e.g. Should English be taught at elementary schools in Japan?) or on another academic area (e.g. Should the possession of firearms be prohibited in the U.S. ? )and present/defend their point of view using the information gathered. Through this semester-long project, students become accustomed to the process of writing a research paper: reviewing the techniques/rules necessary for academic writing (e.g. paragraph/essay development), using the library and the Internet to get necessary information, conducting a questionnaire /interview to support their position on the issue, and weaving the work of others into their own research paper in the APA style. At the end of this semester, students must submit a final paper (8 or more than 8 typed pages including a cover, abstract, and reference pages). In this class, students interact a great deal with one another, so active participation in pair/group work is essential.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This class is designed to prepare students for the iBT TOEFL but will be good for those wanting to succeed academically in English-speaking colleges and universities as well. The iBT TOEFL test is different from the paper version of the test in that it puts more emphasis on authentic communication; the test requires test-takers to use not only all four language skills (listening, reading, speaking, writing) in isolation but a combination of two or more of those skills. This means no longer would students be able to boost their overall score just by studying grammar. In response to the change, an integrated-skills approach will be incorporated in this class; students will be provided with tasks that challenge them to use more than one skill at a time. For instance, students will synthesize and summarize the academic lectures they have heard/read and present it through speaking or writing. Students will complete these tasks in pairs/groups in class or individually at home. In addition to these integrated tasks, students will write essays on a variety of TOEFL-type topics using Criterion (online writing evaluation system) developed by ETS. Good attendance and active participation in class are essential.\n",

Students will be asked to complete TOEIC-style exercises at home, discuss why the wrong answers are wrong in groups and in class and finally take some review tests.Although the main focus is on grammar, students will take a short listening test at the beginning of each class, do some reading exercises and get opportunities for speaking practice on wide-ranging topics including work-related topics.

Through this semester-long project, students become accustomed to the process of writing a research paper: reviewing the techniques/rules necessary for academic writing (e.g. paragraph/essay writing), using the library and the Internet to get necessary information, conducting a questionnaire /interview to support their position on the issue, and weaving the work of others into their own research paper in the APA style. At the end of this semester, students must submit a final paper (8 or more than 8 typed pages including a cover, abstract, and reference pages). In this class, students interact a great deal with one another, so active participation in pair/group work is essential.\n",

In every class, we will challenge ourselves with the task of creating our own \"sub-channel\" scripts or subtitles. It is an activity-based course in which students are expected to learn from practical experience and experimentation.Creativity, imagination, and humor will be highly appreciated. We will also be working towards a common goal- producing a dubbed (\"fukikae\") English version of a segment from a Japanese video of your choice in groups. In the beginning of the course we will work on English-language videos translating the subtitles or dubbed versions and \"re-creating\" the English scripts.After writing Japanese dub scripts for English videos for a few weeks, we finally move on to using Japanese materials to create the English versions.\nIn class, we will use short video segments and work on the translation in pairs or small groups. Class activities will basically follow the same procedure every week:\n1.\tWatching the video segment\n2.\tTranslating and discussing in pairs or groups\n3.\tPresenting the script and sharing each other's work\n4.\tComparing our versions with the original version\n5.\tDiscussing the work and material\n",

        "Course Summary": "Heavy Metal lyrics (late 1960s to present) course\n\nHeavy metal: is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and loudness. The lyrics and performances are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. [from Wikipedia]\n\nThis class will explore heavy metal music from its late 1960s origins until the present day. We will discuss bands within their cultural and historical contexts. We will analyze song lyrics, albums, music videos, and footage of live performances. We will have discussions based on these materials. Students are expected to participate enthusiastically. There will be weekly homework that relates to the in-class topics. There will be a midterm essay test and a final presentation.\n",

It’s an interface between our « self » and social world.  In sociology, this externality can be understood as responsible institutions for our education : family, school, amateur sport, first job, et cetera ; internality must be understood by the embodiement of its education (the body is learning and memorizing unconsciously social conducts). Sociology of body is about the embodiement of such norms. How are we internalizing these social norms ? How these norms are structuring our mind and, de facto, our perception of the world.  Our class will answer to all of these questions.\n",

In the second part of the course, we will examine the so-called “return migration” to Japan. This analysis aims to understand these ethnic minorities, whose temporary migration has gradually turned into a permanent stay. Along the course we aim to consider the main causes and effects of migration, the cultural characteristics of the migrants and their families, and the effects of their settlement on their children education. Additionally, we will discuss the migrants’ identity and the maintenance (or non) of their heritage language. \n",

        "Course Summary": "Researchers from all disciplines, including Policy Management and Environment and Information Studies, will apply sequence analysis methods to tackle problems in their fields (biology, language, manuscript, music, etc.).\n\nSequence analysis is a broad field, covering any kinds of analyses of textual sequences; e.g. those representing genomes (DNA) and proteins (amino acids). The biological sequence analyses include predicting gene function, inferring phylogenetic relationships, and ancestral reconstruction (Coghlan, 2017; Hall, 2017). For instance, phylogenetic trees inferred from viral sequence data can be used to estimate viral emergence, characterize the geographic spread of the virus, and identify instances of adaptive mutations (Martin et al., 2021). The sequence analysis methods have been used not only in the field of biology, but also in genealogy of manuscripts (Barbrook et al., 1998) and quantitative evaluation of melodic similarity (Savage et al., 2018). Thus, text-processing skills necessary to analyze sequence data can be applied to the analysis of data in other fields.\n\nThis course will provide the introduction to the main tools and databases used in the analysis of sequence data and explains how these can be used together to answer biological questions.\n\n",

The course will utilize the basic foundations of quantitative methods (e.g., correlation, regression, means comparisons, and factor analysis) and examine how these are used in designing and reporting research.\n\nThis course is for people who have some prior experience with statistics, but you do not need a high level of ability (or confidence) in math to succeed. We will look at what is required to analyze a variety of statistical tests, and while this means that students will need to run sample data and report results, the focus will be on what the results mean rather than the specific calculations that lead us to those results. To that end, this course looks at the concepts, interpretations, and applications of statistics rather than the math itself. This course will be discussion-based and NOT lecture based, so students should also come prepared and ready to participate each class.\n",

These data skills give you freedom; you’ll be able to look at any data (in any format, and files of any size) and begin exploring data to extract meaning.\n\nThroughout the class, I will emphasize working in a robust and reproducible manner. Reproducibility means that your work can be repeated by other researchers and they can arrive at the same results. For this to be the case, your work must be well documented, and your methods, code, and data all need to be available so that other researchers have the materials to reproduce everything. If a workflow run on a different machine yields a different outcome, it is neither robust nor fully reproducible. These are themes that reappear throughout the class.\n\nThis class focuses primarily on handling tabular plain-text data formats. Tabular data is terrific for honing your data skills. Even if your goal is to analyze other types of data in the future, tabular data serves as great example data to learn with. Developing the text-processing skills necessary to work with tabular data will be applicable to working with many other data types. Thus, this class will teach you useful computational tools and data skills that will be helpful in your research.\n",

On the other hand, in communication, there is a possibility of transmission error, and coding is required to minimize the transmission error. We will consider the basic idea and method for these problems. \n\nInformation theory is a basic theory of expression and transmission of \"information\". Typical applications include data compression, bit error detection / correction, and encryption. Information theory also plays an important role in machine learning algorithms. \n\nThe goal is to learn the quantitative treatment of \"information\" that is used in our daily life.\n",

Each of them is packed with the idea of ​​making the articles of editors, reporters, and writers more interesting and the technology to make the sentences \"more readable\". In this class, you will learn how to write \"sentences that people will read\" through actual editing work. From blogs to novels, we aim to inspire people who want to improve their writing. Keep an editor in yourself. That will dramatically improve your original writing. That is the purpose of the lesson.\n",

The course focuses on document creation as a step in \"information production\" and covers many methodologies, especially those related to structuring and communicating information. In structuring information, we will focus on requirements analysis and outlining to discover what needs to be written and formulate it into a document. Regarding communication, we will follow the concept of paragraph writing and aim to learn how to express information to allow the reader to understand what is being communicated efficiently and without misunderstanding. We will also engage in group discussions, peer review (an activity in which students critique each other's documents and give advice to each other), and publishing the learning process online.\n",

You will be surprised at how deeply you can express your inner self and have the \"joy of writing\". It is a \"moving\" class where you will be moved by the expressions of other students. If you train your ability to think, your ability to express yourself will grow to a comfortable level. First, students learn how to think in order to be able to express their thoughts in words (self-expression and thinking ability). Next, you will be able to convey what you want to say in a way that resonates with others (written expression skills that work in a situation, ways of communicating that enhance media skills). Furthermore, you will develop your ability to express yourself in writing so that you can write persuasively in society, for example, to be hired for job hunting or to attract collaborators on social networking sites (writing skills that open up the results you are aiming for). You will be able to discover subjects that only you can write about, and your originality will flourish (creative and original expression skills). You will be moved by the expressions of other students, make discoveries for yourself, and hone your ability to express yourself in a deep and realistic way with other students in the course. We encourage you to write your best writing in this class and say, \"This is what I wrote when I was a student. You have the power to write.\n",

Specifically, reading and interpreting information on science and technology, which is the conduct of humankind, and describing it in a simpler way.\n The 20th century was called “the century of science”. Remarkable advances in science and technology have contributed to making human life richer and more comfortable. The following 21st century is sometimes called the “century of life science” due to the rapid progress in the elucidation of life phenomena along with genome decoding.\n Our lives are influenced by the benefits of science and technology, but their knowledge has increased dramatically and their specialization has made it difficult for non-experts to understand. Consequently, “Science writing” is becoming increasingly important.\n",

        "Course Summary": "- There are various social problems in the world, and governments implement various policies in response to them. On the other hand, if we take a step back, conceptually, the government sector is necessary because of 'market failures', and the role of the private sector, including third sectors such as NPOs, is increasing because of 'government failure'.\n- As a result, the relationship between the government sector and the private sector on individual social issues has gone beyond the simple picture of 'policy makers' and 'policy receivers' and has developed into a complex relationship. Therefore, even if one's own job is not as a public servant but as an employee of a large company, a start-up entrepreneur or a social entrepreneur, many people can be central actors of public policy, not only as the demand side of public policies but also as the supply side responsible for solving social problems.\n- This lecture focuses on the process of policy formation, evaluation and revision that is required to become a central actor of such public policy.\n",

The new challenges arising from the climate change cannot be also overlooked. In this lecture, we will focus on Germany, which faces similar challenges to Japan. In contrast to the UK and France, where there was a concentration of urbanisation in London and Paris, the urbanisation has been progressed in Germany by maintaining a polycentric structure, and the cities are now developing an urban planning programme in collaboration with the federal and state governments in order to ensure the future development potential of the city. The aim of this lecture is to clarify the characteristics of German cities using this programme as a guide, and to gain implications for regional revitalisation in Japan.\n",

It involves a wide range of stages from the earth to life to human society. For this reason, subjects related to the environment are currently being segmented and specialized.With this context, this course helps the students to learn specialized knowledge in the field of extremely wide sectors related to environment in order to have a solid foundation of this diverse topic. A comprehensive review of a wide range of environmental fields from a unified viewpoint of science and technology is provided. This helps in deepening knowledge while viewing the entire environmental field, even if the student advances to one specific areas for his/her research or profession. In each lesson, we will take up specific cases, that can easily be understood with view point of science and technology application in the field of environmental management.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This course provides a broad overview of history and phenomena of NPOs and NGOs in Japan. We consider the possibilities and challenges of NPOs/NGOs through the various perspectives and actual cases. The activities of NPOs/NGOs have pioneered new social business and have played key roles in various fields of environment, international aid, social welfare, and education. We have understood that the emergence of NPOs has been significant since the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake in Kobe. However, the history and the reality have not been fully well known, even though NPOs in private sector have taken roles historically in public-interest activities in Japan.\n\nThe objective of this class is to understand the history, the current situation and the characteristics of NPOs/NGOs in Japan from actual cases and various data. The goal is not to understand “know-how” of establishment and management of NPOs, but to be able to explain significance of existence, effectiveness and potentiality of such activities and organizations based on objective facts and your own ideas.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Organizations increasingly rely on technologies to operate, organize, and innovate in this digital/big data era. This course focuses on the relationship between technologies and organizations: how technologies shape organizational practices and performances, and how technologies transform the way we work, facilitate collaboration across space and time, and afford new forms of organizing and innovating. It is essential for managers to understand and utilize technologies to successfully manage and solve current organizational and managerial problems. Topics covered in this course include the IT impact on organizations, new forms of organizing such as online communities, social media, and digital platforms, IT-enabled open innovation, and the future of work with cutting-edge digital technologies including AI, algorithms, automation and data analytics.\n\nThe learning will take place via multiple aspects combining class discussions, lectures, case studies, and a group project. The class will cover various topics that represent cutting-edge issues in management and technologies based on seminal and most advanced research and practices in technologies and organizations. These topics are chosen to complement learning in other courses and will introduce important concepts, perspectives, frameworks, and approaches that are necessary and timely for a career in managing organizations and technologies.\n\nStudents are expected to attend the class fully prepared to discuss the assigned readings. You need to read articles or a case beforehand and contribute to in-class discussions. Active participation is the key to learning in this course. You will actively engage with the discussions in class to collectively make sense the assigned readings and understand the practical implications of the readings and topics covered in the class. You are also expected to reflect what you have learned in the class and to take into account those learning for your group project. Theoretical perspectives, frameworks, and findings of the literature will help you think deeply and guide you how you can address business/managerial problems you face in the real-world practice.\n",

We train the power of expression, which is the foundation of presentation, from the very beginning with an emphasis on the ability to think. If you train your ability to think, your ability to express yourself will grow to a pleasant level. First, you will grasp the technique of deriving the \"subject\" (what you want to convey most) from within yourself while actually expressing it. You will be able to discover your own unique and convincing subject matter, and your ability to express yourself and your originality will open up. Next, while gaining the trust and empathy of others, students will develop the ability to convey what they want to say in a way that resonates with others (expressive and media skills that work in the context of the situation). Furthermore, we will train your \"ability to express yourself in a way that is persuasive and understandable to society,\" such as getting hired for job hunting or attracting collaborators on social networking sites (expressive ability that will pave the way to the desired results). This is an \"inspiring\" class where students can express themselves without being passive, and encounter many expressions that will shake the hearts of other students. This is a class in which students can feel the realistic touch of expression and the deep interaction between students. We hope you will experience the joy of communicating through expression in this class. You have the power of expression.\n",

If the other party does not keep it, how do we make them keep it?\n　In Japan, it is said that circumstances other than the contract are taken into consideration and that judges do not understand business.\n　If so, why is this true? What is the difference between the court world and the business world?\n　There are various types of contracts, but what kind of law or economic mechanism are they based on?\n　We would like to study these points from multiple perspectives so that even beginners can understand them.\n\n",

One is to be submitted by the government (Cabinet submission bills) and another to be submitted by Diet members (Diet member submission bills). Among them, most of the bills to be submitted by the Cabinet will be formulated based on reports discussed by councils, committees and study groups etc. composed of external experts, established by ministries which are required to submit bills.\n　In this workshop, I will first give lectures on the basic knowledge about a policy decision making process (such as process up to the enactment of laws) and the information and communication fields such as AI, the Internet he could services, and broadcasting media.\n　In addition, as background knowledge, we will also study consensus-building methods in the government, the role of the Kantei (the Prime Minister’s official residence) in achieving policy harmony throughout the government and the history of its function.\n　Moreover, we will learn about \"how to make laws (policies)\", through presentations and discussions by students on ① how to identify real problems, ② how to choose solution methods, ③ how to collect opinions of stakeholders and to make compromises among interested parties (persuasion of opponents, formation of majority etc.).\n　This workshop will not deal with the technical wording on how to write laws.\n",

Rather than pursuing mathematical rigor, I would like to give priority to students mainly to understand game theoretical way of thinking. Therefore, advanced mathematical knowledge is not required, but the explanation itself is quite logical.The content to be dealt mainly with orthodox noncooperative game theory, but includes recent topics on bounded rationality (evolutionary game theory) and experiments in strategic interaction, and part of cooperative game theory. The participants of this lecture should not be satisfied with superficially describing complex social phenomena, but through active analysis using the framework of such game theory, I want you to acquire a clear understanding of the mechanism of social phenomena and flexible thinking that excludes fixed ideas on social problems.\n",

In the class, we plan to consider career issues and issues from a practical perspective that promotes one's career design and development. In this class, rather than giving an overview of various theories about careers, we will proceed with the lessons from the perspective of what challenges to overcome in order to carry out career design in a practical manner. In addition, we plan to invite corporate career consultants / advisors, people in charge of education and training centers, or people with unique career histories to the class to talk about various practical issues facing career development. is. \n",

In order to achieve this end, design-led research and development hold the essential key to identify how people experience the shortcomings of existing products and services. \n\nHowever, design-led research (design research) differs from “asking people what they want”. You need to dig deep into the structural and systemic problems that people feel subconsciously, and your task as a design researcher is to embody that problem collaboratively. Sometimes you need to generate a tool for people to make their problems visible by themselves, sometimes you need to make a diagram for people to visualise the complex stakeholder relationships. \n\nThis course provides students with basic knowledge and skill in design-led research activities. This course will ask students to actively engage with design research.I would recommend that those who wish to take this course have experience in developing a product or service of any kind (for private or public sector, tangible or intangible) previously.\n",

And what should we be mindful of when facilitating a workshop? To contemplate and learn about these aspects, we will conduct group work to conceive and design workshops alongside the regular class sessions. In the latter part of the course, each group will implement their designed workshop for their fellow students. Through this, we aim to practically enhance our skills and understanding in \"workshop design.\" Ultimately, each student will compile the key elements of workshop design they have grasped into a pattern language format, preparing to apply this knowledge to their own practice.\n",

Specifically, we will first overview the development of manga culture in Taiwan since the 1950s, referring to the works of Chen Chu-wei, a leading researcher of ACGN culture. Next, I will give an overview of some of the topics that arose in the 1990s and 2000s. After that, we will discuss the trend of master thesis on ACGN culture, and the second half of the class will be devoted to the basic knowledge of ACGN culture in Japan. The second half of the class will be devoted to teaching basic knowledge of Japanese ACGN culture. As a concrete example of the localization of ACGN culture, the Japan-Taiwan collaboration puppet show \"Thunderbolt Fantasy\" will be introduced.\n\n",

However, how human intelligence possesses that \"situatedness\" is still a mystery. Past researches on AI have not yet obtained any answers, even hypotheses. Although the technology about deep learning is expected to bring huge impact on changes of the world, it theoretically will not give any answers to this problem at all. This is the PROBLEM the current AI is faced with.It is a high and hard obstacle. As long as the researchers do not get some ideas to go over it, the AI researches will not get a new future. Having provided about this problem of AI, this lecture aims to encourage students think of their own intelligence.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This lecture will discuss the role of the media in policy formation from various perspectives. The media is called the fourth power after the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In the past, mass communication such as newspapers and television was the main form of communication, but now electronic media such as the Internet and SNS also have great influence. The media not only checks power, but also plays a large role in shaping public opinion. The two roles of checking power and shaping public opinion will also play important roles in policy formation. Those who hold the reins of power in the executive branch and those who draft bills in the legislative branch place particular importance on the power of newspaper editorials. In this lecture, eleven editorial and editorial board members who write editorials and signed columns at the Nihon Keizai Shimbun will discuss the role of the media in policy formation in their respective fields of expertise. The first half of the 14 lectures will discuss the transformation of media due to digitalization and its relationship with domestic policy formation, and the second half will discuss the relationship between policy formation and the media in various countries such as the United States, China, and South Korea.\n",

In this course, we will introduce the overview of contemporary art that has been systematized so far (players such as artists, curators, gallerists, etc., and its history), as well as the social and historical background of contemporary art. In parallel with the lectures, individual and group work will be conducted to help students develop their own perspectives to interpret the contemporary world in various ways as expressive artists (in the broad sense of the term, not limited to art).\nIn addition, by setting an assignment of \"Proposals for society mediated by 'contemporary art',\" participants are encouraged to connect their own areas of interest with contemporary art (in the broad sense of artworks, social context, concepts, etc.) and to independently express and propose their own ideas.\n",

However, how people make or avoid making choices is influenced not only by personal factors but also by the social environment in which decision-making occurs.\n\nPoor or good choice-making can be influenced by various conditions, which may be attributed to individuals and/or the social environment:\n\nIncome constraints (environment/individual)\nLack of knowledge (environment/individual)\nLack of information (environment/individual)\nLack of [good] choices (environment)\nLimited access to choices (environment/individual)\nLack of freedom or too much freedom (environment)\nLaziness or decision-making fatigue (environment/individual)\nAnalyzing choice behaviors by considering these conditions can help uncover underlying problems and improve solutions.\n\nThe course draws on arguments from the works of Daniel Kahneman, Cass R. Sunstein, Richard Thaler, Peter L. Berger and T. Luckmann, Niklas Luhmann, Herbert A. Simon, among others.\n",

There may be those who say \"The Social Contract\" or \"Self-Help\".\nThere are many commentaries on these \"The classics\", and there are also websites like \"Quick Reference\". Above all, if you read them in a normal way, you will be swallowed up.\nIn this class, therefore, we will steadily read important historical (but short) texts that everyone seems to have read but has not, or pretends to have read, and we will all think about their implications. There are no commentaries or 'quick-understand' websites.Only the intellectual work of the participants there are.\nThe subject matter will be the documents that have influenced modern and contemporary Japan from the opening of the country to the present. We would like to discover new possibilities of \"Classics and Modernity\" by reconsidering what this country has thought and when from a modern perspective.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)\n",

It is intimately linked with disciplines such as sociology, economics, political science, epidemiology, anthropology, and more. In this class, the focus will be on the field of social demography, which closely aligns with sociology.\n\nStudents will be introduced to the key indicators (e.g., life expectancy, total fertility rate), concepts (e.g., cohort), and theories (e.g., demographic transition theory) that define demography. They will also explore significant findings from research within social demography.\n\n To enhance understanding of the materials, the course will include not only lectures but also demographic analysis exercises, exams and compilation of demographic report. \n\n＊Please be aware that attendance is mandatory. Exceeding a certain number of absences, including for varsity sports, internship, job hunting, failure to submit assignments, or poor participation in group work, leads to automatic failure.\n",

Dialogue is not about winning or losing, but rather a process of thinking from a variety of perspectives, enhancing collective knowledge, and building one's own ideas through reflections. Asynchronous dialogue allows everyone to have a chance to speak up and think things over.\n　This lecture explores how companies solve social issues through their core business. A company is made up of a variety of stakeholders. How do we think about and revitalize the economy and society based on the relationships with various stakeholders in management? The main aim of the class is to examine the measures to achieve this. There are various modes of management in the economy and companies. The goal of this lecture is to enable students to better understand the characteristics of the parties involved in the company, to understand the significance of accountability, and to recognize the need to cooperate and build relationships with these parties. These contents will be discussed in a dialogue about corporate management as it should be in relation to society, taking into account examples from the real world. Based on the issues that companies need to solve, we will explore from both theoretical and applied perspectives why addressing these issues will revitalize the social economy by making companies responsive to society (corporate social responsibility)..\n",

        "Course Summary": "Economics is the study of the problem of managing rare resources as efficiently as possible. The allocation of resources is determined by the interactions between consumers and firms. It is essential to analyze the results of various economic activities in order to understand consumer behaviors and firm strategies. Therefore, by modeling behaviors of consumers and firms, it is necessary to learn about supply and demand of goods. Economic trading exists when there is a balance between demand and supply of goods, which can be understood by the concept of market equilibrium. Further, based on the concept of social welfare, the study discusses the policies to achieve the desirable resource allocation. Microeconomics provides a theoretical framework for such economic analyses. This course aims to understand how the concepts of microeconomics solve the existing economic issue. Although mathematics is used in this course, the main aim is for intuitive understanding through the use of diagrams. Knowledge of microeconomics opens up new perspectives in other fields such as business administration, politics, and sociology.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Lectures on the fundamentals of microeconometrics and methods of causal inference will be given. For example, it is quite difficult to correctly estimate how much of an effect of having an education has on increasing income. This is because individuals who have had better access to education have the potential to earn higher incomes by nature, for example, because they are healthier or because their parents have higher incomes. One goal of microeconometrics is to measure the true effect of education, taking into account the impact of such individual attributes and other factors on income (the analysis is not limited to education and labor, but includes a variety of topics such as healthcare and business, of course).\nIn the first half of the lecture, students will learn the computation of the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, the interpretation of the results, and the assumptions necessary for the OLS estimator to have statistically desirable properties. The second half of the lecture will introduce various methods for making causal inferences when the OLS assumptions are not satisfied.\n",

It’s an interface between our « self » and social world.  In sociology, this externality can be understood as responsible institutions for our education : family, school, amateur sport, first job, et cetera ; internality must be understood by the embodiement of its education (the body is learning and memorizing unconsciously social conducts). Sociology of body is about the embodiement of such norms. How are we internalizing these social norms ? How these norms are structuring our mind and, de facto, our perception of the world.  Our class will answer to all of these questions.\n",

Topics for discussion change every year to keep up with both regional and global developments.\nThis year's workshop focuses on the theme \"Asia in Mixed Cultures.\" We are increasingly witnessing the blending of cultures at both individual and national levels. More young people today are born and raised in multicultural environments, giving them the freedom to embrace the cultures they prefer. Culture is no longer solely inherited; it can be chosen. Additionally, social and physical environments are evolving to accommodate this cultural blending. This prompts us to question the relevance of national boundaries, countries, uniqueness, and differences. What defines Asia? What does it mean to be an Asian?\nTo answer these questions, we will design various activities, lectures, interactive sessions with guest speakers, and simulated fieldwork, among other methods, to generate a comprehensive understanding of Asia in a changing world. We will introduce immersive technologies to facilitate students’ first-hand observations while conducting simulated fieldwork on campus.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This class aims for enhancing the understanding of contemporary international political economy, security and society mainly in East Asia through examining theories, policy frameworks and practices.All sessions are conducted in English.”Region” could be defined in various terms. In international relations, it generally indicates the multilateral groupings of neighboring nations. However, when it comes to the term regionalism, it suggests a functional relation that bundles multiple nations with their political, economic and cultural inheritance, often based on the geographical advantages. Region could be formed either inherently or arbitrary. Thus, the \"Region/Regionalism\" is a dynamic concept of geopolitics/economics, which rests between the global governance, the bilateral rational choice of the government, and people's perceptions. This course specifically focuses on following agendas: 1)theory and practices of regionalism in East Asia, 2)security in Asia-Pacific region, 3)Japan’s foreign policy on regionalism.\n",

What are their powers and competences, and what is the process of creating European policies and laws? The lecture will then address the workings of the European Union considering specific policy fields like foreign policy or security policy as well as the handling of specific problem situations like Russia's attack of Ukraine, the Corona pandemic, the refugee issue, environmental challenges, Brexit or the financial crisis, before finally looking at various options for future developments.

Before we optimistically assume that the world of globalization is a world connected by a single set of values, we must begin by asking the question: do people really understand each other? For people to communicate with each other, words are needed, but can these words function as a transparent and colorless tool? And when we talk about \"people\" and \"people\", do they really communicate with the same values? With these questions in mind, this course will examine the meaning of \"language\" and \"people\" from the perspectives of philosophy, literature, history, and art, before turning to actual events.\n\n",

The Earth system is now operating in “a no-analogue state”, meaning that previous experience may not be a reliable guide to the future. Human actions occurring in one place can have dramatic effects in faraway places. The Earth system has entered a new phase in which human actions are threatening the Earth’s life support systems and drawing down the planet’s natural capital in an unsustainable manner.

        "Course Summary": "The rapid economic development of postwar Korea, called “compressed modernity,” was realized in the state-led development economic system from the 1960s. South Korea, a typical developing country, has undergone a dynamic transformation after the development era of the 1960s and 1970s, the June 1987 Declaration of Democracy, the 1997 IMF Economic Crisis, and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, the government-led economic system, which was effective during that period, has lost its expiration date. The opening of the domestic market and the transition to a high-wage nation have fundamentally changed the basic framework of the Korean economy, and the impact of globalization is accelerating such movements.\nGlobal companies from South Korea, such as Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, and POSCO, are active on the world stage, while they are fiercely competing with companies in developed and developing countries.\nThen, what kind of transformation has Korean society undergone during that time? It is a historical fact that South Korea has become a very prosperous country, driven by the rapid growth of the chaebol, and the economic level has risen significantly overall. It can also be considered that it has achieved the rank of developed countries. However, domestic economic disparities are widening, and there is considerable friction and conflict between groups that can feel affluence and those who do not, forming a background for political conflict.\nIn this lecture, we will examine how Korean society, led by chaebols, is changing amid historical environmental changes.\n",

Students will analyze the historical background of the Japanese migration to Latin America, the settlement and community development. The analysis of the historical processes will enable the students to understand the contemporary features of Nikkei communities in different Latin American societies. In the second part of the course, we will examine the so-called “return migration” to Japan. This analysis aims to understand these ethnic minorities, whose temporary migration has gradually turned into a permanent stay. Along the course we aim to consider the main causes and effects of migration, the cultural characteristics of the migrants and their families, and the effects of their settlement on their children education. Additionally, we will discuss the migrants’ identity and the maintenance (or non) of their heritage language. \n",

        "Course Summary": "Malay society (the Melayu world) refers to the cultural sphere that shares the culture of Melayu; it is a maritime world across the islands of Southeast Asia. Although this region is now divided into several nations, such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Indonesia, it was once a space for many ethnic groups and kingdoms, each flexibly connected. People in the Melayu world are not only from Southeast Asia, but merchants and immigrants from the East, West, North, and South (East Asia, Australia, Western Europe, etc.) also participated in the distribution of goods and people in a vast trade network that connects the world.\n　In this lecture, we will learn about the Melayu world's values, cosmology, history, and culture from a relative perspective. I hope you will find some ideas to escape from the idea that our standards should be \"Westernized,\" \"Modernized,\" or \"Civilized.\" For specific topics, we will re-examine matters such as the management of modern borders and resources of nature and the form of nation-states and attempt to relativize these values.\n",

Since the collapse of the Suharto authoritarian regime in 1998, Indonesia has experienced remarkable economic growth as well as democratization. At the same time, in the society where democracy has begun to take root, Islam has become more visible and has been exerting its power in various aspects of society. In this class, students will learn the reality of Indonesia with these characteristics and the changes in society by examining individual topics. Although we will be dealing directly with Indonesian society, we will also consider the cases from other regions, such as emerging countries in Asia that have similar characteristics or are experiencing similar changes, and the Islamic world in the Middle East, where turmoil continues.\n",

        "Course Summary": "The 'unification of the world' that originated in the Age of Discovery accompanying the changes in its core regions, passed through the 'long 19th century' (from the beginning of the Age of Revolution to the outbreak of the First World War), when nation-states became the dominant unit of the global network, further progress was made as 'globalisation' after the Second World War. Today, the free movement of people, goods, capital and information move more freely than ever before, its scale is expanding and various societies are becoming more and more interconnected. On the other hand, the influence of the nation-state remains strong, which has formed a sense of national unity by emphasising homogeneity of ethnicity, language and religion, and has sought stability based on it.\nIn the irreversible process of globalisation, can nation-states realise a society where people of different nationalities and ethnicities can live together, recognising their cultural differences and building equal relationships? If so, how can this be achieved? The aim of this class is to seek answers to these questions.\n",

        "Course Summary": "By the Soviet Perestroika which was started by Gorbachev in the mid of 1980s, the communist regimes of the world had great shook. Then, the Soviet Union was collapsed in the end of 1991, most of the former USSR the Eastern European countries abandoned communism; and the dream of communism seemed to be disappeared. However, the many communist regimes have been kept in East Asia and Southeast Asia, although many of their system have been modified. In addition, many of the former USSR states have been keeping the undemocratic regimes, and some of them are almost same to the communist regime in the different names. On the other hand, the pressures of democratization have been given not only from the international society, but from the people in some states, although there are many opinions if such pressures would be effective or not.\n\nIn this course, we will try to compare the political systems focusing on the political changes of the former USSR states after the end of cold war.\n\nIn addition, it seems to be extremely interesting to focus on the Russian elections, which are rarely focused on in the general media, and the political changes surrounding them, and we are planning to have a guest lecturer concerning this problem.\n\nNote that taking this course in conjunction with \"Regions and Society (Europe and CIS),\" a course the instructor is offering in the spring semester, will provide a deeper understanding.\n",

        "Course Summary": "In a world where a multilingual society has become a reality, we are facing a situation where the existing view of language is being forced to change. On the one hand, there is English, the language that dominates the world by far, and while on the other hand there are only a few speakers left. But is English, which we believe that dominate the world really a language in its own right? For example, in the language of downtown London, the arrival of many immigrants in the area has led to the emergence of a language that has some English elements, but which is also hard to describe. In a situation where there is so much ethnic mixing, various forms of intermediary languages are emerging, and the field of education, for example, is beginning to have to adapt to this. This lesson will introduce the view of language in the context of the multilingualism that is emerging in the new situation and which involves the dismantling of the concept of 'language'.\n",

        "Course Summary": "This course aims to give students an overview of main issues discussed in contemporary political philosophy. Political philosophy is distinguished from political science or sociology in that it adopts principally normative approach. As normative theory, political philosophy has made a remarkable revival and development since John Rawls, American philosopher, published A Theory of Justice in 1971. What problems does contemporary political philosophy focus on? How does it attempt to solve those problems? The first part of this course makes clear a variety of criticisms addressed to modern political philosophy in order to understand the issues that contemporary theories have raised since the 1970’s. The second deals with three conceptions of freedom, each of which represents particular position in contemporary political philosophy. The third explains fundamental ideas of Rawlsian theory of justice, and also three criticisms directed towards his liberal conception. The fourth shows how political philosophers tackle concrete issues raised by today's social and global situation, particularly with regard to culture, gender, and global justice. \n",

        "Course Summary": "In this course, students will comprehensively cultivate the worldview, problem recognition ability, leadership, and other skills needed when leading organizational and societal reforms or innovations in companies, governments, NPOs, and more after graduation.\n\nSpecifically, based on the instructor's experience in approximately 50 organizations, including governments, corporations, and foundations where they played the role of a catalyst for reform, as well as case studies of reforms and innovations from various times and regions, students will develop an understanding of the essence of reform and innovation and its methodology, and gain insights into the societal and organizational perspectives required therein.\n\nThe course content includes: 1) Perspectives on world order (e.g., Westphalian System, Pax Americana, UN-centricism, Sino-Barbarian Order, etc.), 2) Fundamental structures of modern states (e.g., democracy, capitalism, nation-states, bureaucratism, etc.), and 3) Trends in social change (e.g., digitalization, globalization, decentralization, etc.). With these fundamentals in mind, the course delves deeper into the backgrounds and transitions that led to innovative systems/services like \"container shipping,\" \"Shinkansen (bullet trains),\" and \"technical standards,\" and social innovations like \"universal health coverage\" and \"compulsory education.\" In class, we will trace the history of reforms (sometimes even \"revolutions\") that occurred during the establishment of these innovations, contemplating the ways of reform and innovation for the next era.\n\n(Note) By the way, there are several other courses at SFC related to \"innovation,\" \"social systems,\" and \"leadership.\" Compared to these, this course offers insights into the essence of \"reform\" and \"innovation\" in society and organizations through a flipped classroom style, using classics, masterpieces, and historical events as references. It is designed to produce complementary learning effects with practical courses.Complete and fluent Japanese skill is required.\n",

The program provides practical training in a variety of skills necessary for professionals in general policy (problem finding and problem solving), such as the following\n\nThe “policy case” describes the process of policy making on a specific policy issue (the part of the policy process from policy formation to policy decision-making, from “discovery of policy issue” to “policy formation,” “policy decision (selection),” “policy implementation,” and “policy evaluation”). Embedded in this “policy process” is the cutting-edge, specialized, and cross-disciplinary knowledge that moves people, organizations, and society, which is necessary to solve the problems of real society.\n\nBased on the above recognition, this course is designed to create a new academic commons at SFC by creating a “policy casebook” that brings together knowledge related to “practical knowledge” (policy process) through the experience of “practical knowledge” (policy process).\n",

When the pressure exceed the capacity, ecosystems may change irreversibly and enter to a unstable and unsustainable state. This sounds self-evident to every one but on paper only, no real experience. This course interpret high resolution images and calculate the land price, agricultural products, and CO2 absorptions through simple exercise. Through the processes we will learn the procedureof ecosystem assessment, the knowledge to understand the status and functions, and services of environment. By putting the results on the frame of stock and flow we will rethink the role of land capital, industrial capital and natural capital in modern society, and clarify the precondition of sustainability.\n",

On the other hand, it is an area where commercial and residential areas coexist, with a high concentration of small-scale buildings, and it is expected to consider how to enhance disaster preparedness and create a fusion of old and new local culture in the future. We propose to revitalize the town in the future by arranging facilities for public use in the shopping district.\n\nTherefore, this studio will design facilities for public use for the shopping district, based on the history of Koenji and its position in Tokyo, with the aim of maintaining and developing Koenji in the future.\n\nWhat role can small public spaces play in the shopping district as a whole? What kind of network, boundary, and form can the public space take with the existing architecture and programs in the surrounding area in mind?\n",

        "Course Summary": "“Cities have always been places where production and commerce, working and living are physically and functionally integrated. Only with the rise of modern industry have zoning regulations been introduced to separate these functions in space. However, what is the role of such regulations when industry is digitized increasingly emission-free, and based on innovation more than mass production? How should working and living be combined to make mobility and energy consumption become more sustainable? And what are the opportunities in creating urban areas based on social equity and resilience, in a volatile world characterized by digital disruption, migration and demographic shifts?” (The Industrious City, 2021, Lars Müller Publisher). \n\nThis course will question how to balance the ecological and social imperatives of our time with the economic and aesthetic functions of cities, especially in the unpredictable future. There are no easy answers to this question, but in pursuit of this topic, we will investigate a wide range of urban and architectural theories, technologies, and practices. We will reflect upon histories in the development of architecture, infrastructure, and urban planning to provide a context for analyzing the contemporary city as a complex system. \n\nThroughout the course, practitioners and theorists from various design disciplines will be invited to examine case studies from Japan and around the world.The topics will be wide in range, from aesthetics, demographic change, and design, to energy use, economics, and social patterns as they affect the processes and outcomes of urbanization. Students are encouraged to debate and exchange ideas of the concepts presented and to form and express their own opinions. \n",

        "Course Summary": "　The world’s nations face rapid aging, and in Japan’s unprecedented super aging society, 30% of the population will be 65 or older by 2030, rising to 40% by 2055. The world’s eyes are upon Japan to see how we handle this situation. Publicly-financed medical care costs exceed 33 trillion yen, and are climbing by one trillion yen annually. I believe that this severe crisis presents itself, on the contrary, as an opportunity to share our accumulated know-how with the global nations in similar straits. The average human lifespan in Japan is 80.9 years, 74.5 of them lived in reasonable health, leaving 6.4 years spent in a bedridden or similar state. Approximately 66% of lifelong medical expenses occur after age 60, with about half remaining after age 70, and some 20% occurring during the final year of life. However, recent research suggests that medical care costs do not expand with a longer life; in fact, healthy longevity sees across-the-board decreases in medical care costs. In other words, achieving healthy longevity not only results in a better QOL (quality of life) for the vital individual and family, but also positively impacts rising publicly-financed medical care costs.\n",

Of these, I will explore, in particular, the experiential world surrounding “images” from a psychoanalytic perspective. How a person can understand “images” richly and deeply depends on the spread and depth of the area of experiences possessed by the reader of such images. Therefore, to understand the entity that reads the images itself, I will place emphasis on the process of discussing a wide range of image experiences.\n",

Kinematics is focusing on the displacement, velocity, acceleration and their angular alternatives, namely the result of the movement.Kinetics is focusing on the force/ moment, power and energy, namely, the source of the movement. I addition to these approaches, since our human motion is caused by the signal from our brain. A neuro physical approach is necessary for sports biomechanics. In this lecture, we will study how sports biomechanics enhance the athletes performance and prevent injury.\n",

Come try using a quantum computer yourself!\n\nQuantum information processing (QIP) is a fast-growing, interdisciplinary field spanning both classical computer science and quantum physics. QIP is addressing fundamental questions about computability, and the technologies being developed in QIP-related research will have a powerful impact on classical computing as the evolution of IT dictated by Moore's Law brings us to the level of building computers out of individual atoms. Over the coming decades, the principles of QIP will be critical to understanding and developing information technologies. Thus, studying QIP is valuable even for students who are not planning research careers in the field.\n\nThrough the Keio Quantum Computing Center, we will be using IBM's best quantum computers.This opportunity is unique to SFC -- very few universities anywhere in the world have access to these machines.Come join us so you can brag to your friends!\n",

        "Course Summary": "The idea of \"open design\" was born around 2010, as 3D printers and digital fabrication tools became popular and various design files were uploaded and shared on the Internet.\n\nIt is a new democratized design culture in which designers are not the authority and monopolist as in the past, but rather everyone is encouraged to \"share\" their design ideas.\n\nMore than a decade later, data for 3D printers is now in daily shared.\n\nAnd we have learned through practice that the \"open design\" approach is socially very effective in the production of assistive technology for the handicapped people, where conventional standarized design products could not reach, and in emergency manufacturing during disasters such as the Covid-19.\n\nIn this class, while learning about this history and backgrounds, students will learn through practice about a new trend called \"open source urbanism\" as a direction toward which \"open design\" will move in the next decade Specifically, students will create \"inclusive benches\" over the course of the fall semester, learning important concepts such as measurement and reproduction of existing benches, parametric design, the concept of inclusivity, and the arrangement and conversion of benches. Each week, you will be given a production assignment, so you will update your design proposal a total of five times. In the process, we will also have discussions with other students in the class about what is truly \"inclusive\" in the city.\n\nThis class is intended for students who are already able to create 3D data using 3D-CAD (fusion 360, Blender, Rhino, etc). Only those who have basic 3D skills in product design, architectural design, furniture design, etc. and have no problem communicating in English should take this class.\n\nIn addition, as a textbook for learning open design,\nOpen Design Now | Why design cannot remain exclusive\" http://opendesignnow.org/index.html\nwas published in the Netherlands in 2011, and I supervised its Japanese edition. https://opendesignnow.jp/\nI hope you will have read through the contents of this book before class.\n\n",

The penetrations of tiny and affordable sensors and computers and the high performance computing available with cloud services result in DSP everywhere. However, because of the discrete nature of digital signal, DSP needs to be properly implemented and the results should be properly comprehended. Otherwise, DSP may lead us to a solution which is artificially produced by its discrete nature. In this class, students learn the theory and principles of digital signal processing through hands on using MATLAB/Simulink. This class proceeds with the hands-on-first, theory-later policy. Every topic, we basically start with the implementation of signal processing system or application , then later study how and why it works that way with the minimum set of theoretical study. \n",

We can ask about the lives of others, on the one hand, from the process of formation through social relations and the environment (interaction with bodies, objects, and space), and on the other hand, from the method of utilization in the field. Through discussion, we ultimately aim to pioneer research on the process of \"intelligence\" generation rooted in the reality of human life and death.\n",

        "Course Summary": "As executives of non-profit and for-profit organizations think about the organization's medium- to long-term strategy, the department that develops the strategy, under the direction of the executives, collects and analyzes the information. For example, in the case of marketing(demand-side data) research, executives may order the marketing department to conduct street research to determine the preferences of the target audience, and the analysis works to uncover the cause-and-effect relationship. In the late 1990s, the explosive spread of information technology made it possible for individuals to use IT to search and collect information, and organizations could easily accumulate a wide variety of information about their customers as data, such as their purchase history. With further advances in information technology in the 2010s, we have been able to keep large amounts of data at a large scale. The infrastructure is being developed to analyze, extract new knowledge and create value. In recent years, these large amounts of data are referred to as big data. One of the optimal statistical analysis, correlation analysis, which investigates the relationship between two factors, has been used in some cases to make decisions. In addition, in May 2013, the government announced the “Creation of the World’s Most Advanced IT Nation” declaration as the new IT strategy of the second Abe cabinet regarding open data, which declares the public data held by the government will be provided to the people in a form that can be used for secondary purposes, and aims to realize the creation of new businesses and innovation through public-private cooperation by interconnecting it with data held by companies. Further use of these data is changing the social systems of markets, organizations, citizens and governments. In this course, in order to develop human resources that can respond to the above social systems, we aim to integrate IT, analytics, and design in order to nurture human resources that will lead to the development of data scientists who can conduct research on architects who handle big data and understand information strategies that include systems. \n",

Through this course, we aim to help them acquire the basic data literacy and the ability to think with data in order to survive in modern society.\n\nIn this course, students will learn the basics of machine learning by adjusting their own data.\n\nThis is based on the content covered in the \"Emergency of Data Driven Society and Strategy\" (Hereinafter referred to as the \"Basic Course\" )(There is no excuse for not knowing the contents of the Basic Course. It is strongly recommended that students take Basic Course.)\n\nThis is not a course to train experts in information science and big data processing.\n-Natural Language Processing\n-Image Processing\n-Machine Learning\n-Data infrastructure construction\n-Real-time processing, etc.\n\n★Intended Audience\n\n- Rather than information science geeks, people who really want to make a difference in the world through analysis and data utilization.\n- People who want to understand how data and analytics are useful in this world and want to acquire the basic skills to do so.\n- People who want to learn firsthand about the relationship between problem solving, decision making and analysis.\nPeople who have tried various types of analysis in the past, but do not understand the points that create value.\n\n★(Reference) Comments from past students (excerpt)\n\n- Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the whole year. It was the best class.\n\n- It was a great class. \"Mr. Ataka's giver's attitude had a huge human impact on me, more than the content of the class. The deep insightful feedback on what we were thinking was the best thing that ever happened to me as a student. Thank you very much. Not only me, but I am sure many other students were ignited by the lecture.\n\n- I learned how to live as a businessman from his various talks. I learned a lot about how to be a businessman from his various talks, and I feel I had a great time experiencing how to be a professional.\n\n- I am convinced that the ICT industry will create wealth.\n\n- Since I started the course last semester, it has definitely been the hardest course I have taken in my three years of college. The weekly assignments were really tough and often took me until midnight. However, looking back on it now, I think that the experience of struggling with my own hands became my flesh and blood, and I have learned a lot from it. I'm really sad to see it end, because the data-driven class has been indispensable to me for the past year.\n\n- Thank you for the year! I would like to see this class made into a book or video! Please consider it.\n\n- I will do my best in the future so that in 5 or 10 years, I will be glad that I drove all the way to SFC to give this lecture.\n\n- In addition to teaching me how to prepare for and handle data, this course gave me the opportunity to think seriously about how I will live my life and what I will accomplish while I am still in my 20's. I am glad that I took this course.\n\n- I've taken all kinds of classes at sfc over the past four years, but I think the data-driven class is one where you can learn as much as you can through trial and error and worry. It has changed the way I look at the world.\n\n- If I hadn't joined sfc and taken this course, I would have never learned so many things. I would like to change the world in an interesting direction so that people will think that I was glad to have lectured at that time.\n\n- I will continue to work hard on my studies and job hunting so that I can build a career in which I can be involved in the field of data handling. I had a really meaningful time here. It was very stimulating every time! I strongly recommend that younger students take this course as well.\n",

There are many things that are not known until after a series of developments are completed to determine how each individual feels. In order to gather the voices of local residents and reflect on the new community, we should record how residents felt before the development of the community begins.\n\n　Therefore, this course will provide an opportunity to think about the values that residents hold dear through fieldwork and interviews in the area surrounding SFC, where local development is beginning to take place in the near future based on the rail extension project. Through fieldwork, we will also consider whether these values have been adequately verbalized in the local community.\n\nThey will also learn about local issues that are recognized by those who plan development and their solutions. Through the experience of learning about development from both sides, students will develop the ability to understand the other party's position and respond accordingly when they are involved in future planning involving local residents.\n",

        "Course Summary": "The course consists of 3 parts: （1）Basic knowledge of the SDGs/ESG, （2）Financial organs and their practices towards the SDGs/ESG, （3）Developing the index of the SDGs. （1）Basic knowledge of the SDGs/ESG: Students learn the rudiments of the SDGs/ESG. For example, we will explore their concepts, history, the work being done by Japan and other member states, and how to acquire abilities in order to create and achieve a sustainable society.（2）Financial organs and their practices:Students will receive hints in order to make the SDGS index by learning the practices being conducted by economic organs for the SDGs/ESG, by listening to experienced guest speakers. （3）Developing the SDGs index: Students will develop the SDGs index to bring to leaders who will make and accelerate the inflow of investment money towards the SDGs/ESG. \n\nIn September, 2015, at the 70th United Nations General Assembly, member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, along with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The agenda explains the need for not only the government, but also for the private sector and civil society to mobilize all their available resources in order to achieve the goals.\n\nIn 2006, the United Nations proposed the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The organization appealed to institutional investors that it is necessary to incorporate environment (E), society, (S), and government (G) into the investment processes. As a result, interest in global sustainable investment (ESG investment) has increased worldwide, and expected to further accelerate in trend. In Japan, for example, the GPIF (Government Pension Investment Fund) signed with the PRI in 2015. This suggests that interest in sustainable investment has increased among investors.\n\nIn response to this growing interest, an inflow of investment money is required from the financial market to businesses that are aiming to achieve the SDGs. Therefore, indicators that measure information about sustainability and ESG factors play an important role in this process. In other words, it is important that we develop a standardized index of the SDGs that express what it means to promote and progress within the goals.\n\nThe aim of this seminar is to foster students' abilities of creating and accelerating the inflow of investment money for the SDGs/ESG. It is especially key that we are educating the generation who will be the main societal actors in the year 2030, which is the target year for achieving the SDGs. In particular, students will be creating an index that measures the SDGs for companies and businesses by observing lectures and case studies.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Fumihiko Maki (1928-), recipient of numerous international awards including the Pritzker Prize, is one of the world's foremost architects, universally acclaimed for his long-standing design activities and his work. He has designed not only our campus, but also many buildings at Keio University, most notably the libraries in Fujisawa, Mita, and Hiyoshi. In Japan, he has been awarded the AIJ Prize twice, and his many works include the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, Makuhari Messe, and Yokohama City Hall, but it is his international activities and reputation that deserve special mention. He has also been recognized as a practical theorist who introduced Japanese architectural thought to the world. His ideas, which place Japanese cities and their spatiality in the context of the global trend of modernism since the Edo period, have attracted worldwide attention from the perspective of the conflict between localism and globalism in the environment. His work has been highly acclaimed and has been invited to design buildings that symbolize the region and the era around the world, including the WTC site in New York, MIT Media Lab, Bihar Museum in India, Singapore Institute of Technology, the Aga Khan Foundation London Headquarters, and Shenzhen World Culture Center.\n\nKeio University SFC has received a donation from Mr. Fumihiko Maki of valuable materials such as sketches, drawings, models, photographs, manuscripts of his writings, publications, correspondence, etc., which he owned and kept in his possession, and has decided to collect, organize, store, and collect them for future use in research and educational activities both inside and outside Japan. We have decided to collect, organize, store, and collect these materials and to make them available to the public through exhibitions and data for future use in research and educational activities in Japan and abroad. The \"Fumihiko Maki Archive Room,\" located on the renovated fourth floor of the Media Center, which overlooks the entire SFC space designed by Mr. Maki, will not only display and introduce to visitors from around the world the architectural works of Mr. Maki, who has embodied the educational philosophy of Keio University, but will also serve as a historical research resource for current and former students as well as for the public. The aim is to create a digital archive that can be used not only by current students but also by people from all over the world as a historical research resource. We plan to collaborate with the Keio University Art Center, Keio Museum Commons, and the Center for Integrated Research on Digital Media and Content at Keio University in order to create multifaceted and cutting-edge digital content that goes beyond the mere creation of image data.\n\nThis class is designed to help students understand the international trend of urbanism and the historical significance of design activities through the works and footsteps of Mr. Fumihiko Maki, and at the same time, to make the creation of analytical results itself a learning opportunity as a teaching material in which elements and applicable specific knowledge that those studying architectural design should master are accumulated. The course provides a practical learning process about the philosophy of Fumihiko Maki, who advocated humanism in architecture, especially for students who aim to study and research architecture and urban design, utilizing the international trend of urbanism and the position of holding valuable materials on the works and philosophy of the architect Fumihiko Maki.\n\n",

This course is a continuation of the previous semester's 'The Art of Knowledge Compilation - 1'. While the Spring semester focused on input, the Fall semester will include instruction in presentation and writing, so that students can master \"the techniques of thinking critically about specialist knowledge and events in their own minds and compiling knowledge\" as non-specialists. While the first semester focused on economics and the real world, the second semester will focus on a wider range of problem solving. There will be more group work and exercises than in the previous term. In the second semester, we will continue to invite guest speakers from home and abroad and aim to make the classes interactive.

What kind of urban future should we envision in the VUCA (Volatile・Uncertain・Complex・Ambiguous) world?\n\nThe economy and fabric of cities transform due to various factors, as do their spatial qualities. In this course, we will explore the goals of urbanization, the conditions that shape these goals, and the factors and mechanisms of real estate development. We will investigate the cause of transformations in urban economy and space, citing specific examples of real estate and investment case studies from Japan and abroad.\n\nIn addition, we will welcome a professor of MIT who teaches real estate designand a developper in the United States to discuss the future of urban development and consider the future of Japanese cities. At the same time, we will explore the possibilities of real estate design in the post-corona era, considering local values and the rise of the sharing economy.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Although the transition to a digital society has been gradual, COVID-19 has raised expectations for digitalization. In this context, the Internet and the Web have developed as the digital society's foundation and have defined data transfer protocols. However, many data management systems, including establishing digital identity management to identify oneself in cyberspace, are siloed and dependent on individual services such as platform providers. There is little possibility of external verification; thus, users are forced to believe the service providers. To break through this situation, the \"Trusted Web Promotion Council\" was launched by the Cabinet Secretariat in October 2020, and the \"Trusted Web White Paper ver. 3.0\" was published in November 2023. The Trusted Web architecture proposes a new framework that increases the degree of Trust (in other words, the degree to which the other party behaves as expected) by an approach that creates an overlay on top of the current Internet. \n\nIn response to this trend, a group of faculty members in charge of the project established the Trusted Internet Architecture Lab at the SFC Research Institute in collaboration with Fujitsu Limited, intending to construct a new Internet architecture with Trust in mind so that people can use the Internet with confidence. The \"Trusted Internet Architecture Lab\" was established as a laboratory of the SFC Research Institute in collaboration with Fujitsu Limited.\n\nWhen students try to understand the Trusted Internet, it is necessary to foster systematic knowledge from multiple perspectives. Therefore, firstly, this lecture will provide an understanding of the concept of the Trusted Web, which establishes a framework that allows for increased Trust in the Internet. Secondly, this lecture also provides an overview of the basic knowledge required to implement the Trusted Internet and how learners can combine basic knowledge to achieve it. Through this course, we aim to develop human resources who understand the concepts of the Trusted Web and Trusted Internet, which are expected to develop in the future, and who can help build the next generation ICT infrastructure.\n\nThe lecture will consist of four parts. First, the lecture will summarize the discussions leading up to the Trusted Web and discuss digital identity-related technologies. Secondly, the lecture will review the components of each application service that uses digital identities, the technologies required to build digital identities, and how these components have been assembled. Third, we will introduce the recently standardized Verifiable Credentials technology, the essential technology for building the Trusted Web, and explain how this technology allows Trust to be freely expressed. Fourth, we will deepen our understanding of the possibilities by knowing and understanding various use cases. Furthermore, we introduce the importance of international standardization in these discussions, and we will also discuss the importance of non-technical factors such as governance in actual deployment and operation. In addition to a certain depth of understanding of these technologies, we aim to develop human resources who can contribute to designing and constructing advanced and trustworthy digital systems by developing a comprehensive discussion of their actual use, standardization, and governance.\n\nThis course is offered through a donation from Fujitsu Ltd.\n",

In particular, Japan depends on more than 99% of its imports and exports on maritime transportation, which is often described as the Japanese lifeline. \n\nNumerous maritime threats, however, exist around Japan. Those include activities of Chinese Coast Guard ships around the Senkaku islands, large-scale illegal fishing activities in the Sea of Japan and off the Ogasawara Islands, North Korea's spy boats activities, and piracy incidents along Japan’s Sea Lanes of Communication. \n\nHow can the Japan Coast Guard respond to such threats by maritime law enforcement based on international and national law? In the series of lectures, while referring to international law, including international law of the sea, we will attempt to analyze how law enforcement functions in each specific case.\n",

Exploring why his plays are still relevant today, this class will introduce the enduring appeal of his works. This class will also help students understand and appreciate his plays, bearing in mind that they reflect social and cultural contexts in which he wrote. Hopefully, through this class, students will develop a richer sense of humanity in order to play an active role as a global citizen in the 21st century. \n\nUndergraduate students will read a selection of famous scenes, while graduate students need to read the entire play for some of the plays covered in this class. All students receive lectures and write comments on weekly classes. We will watch DVDs of past performances and consider how his plays should be performed today. \n\nGraduate students are expected to facilitate discussions, read one academic monograph on Shakespeare, write a book review, and make use of its content in the final report. \n",

We hope that reading the letters and autobiographies of Yukichi Fukuzawa and Yukichi Fukuzawa will give you an opportunity to think about historical research and history education.The classes will mainly be lecture-style, but we will also include reading original historical materials as appropriate. The details will be explained during the first class.\n",

In this class, we will look at the global environment from this broad perspective and study the scientific basis of the global warming problem. Then, we will take up various global and local examples of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, and extract policy and action patterns that combine individual and public interests. Through this process, students will learn the basics of global warming issues and develop an interdisciplinary perspective to solve them. Students will also acquire the skills necessary for research through literature survey, problem setting, and planning exercises.\n",

        "Course Summary": "With the impressive developments of ICT, a new field of research on learning called Learning Environment Theory is gaining popularity. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing institutions that promote education to make major structural changes.As a result, traditional ideas about the meaning of learning environments, in which formal learning in the classroom and informal learning outside the classroom work together, efforts to create autonomous learning environments are now going through a major transformation. \nLearning Environment Theory has connections with a variety of disciplines, including cognitive science, neuroscience, culture, and communication.\nIn addition to Learning Environment Theory, research on education is exploring the possibility of bringing in new perspectives, such as globalization and education, integrated education/individualized autonomous learning, and situated learning. Consequently, the idea of Environmental Design is gaining importance as well.\nIn these lectures, four faculty members will discuss ICT-based learning environments based on research in their respective fields at this important time, with the aim of producing human resources with a broad range of knowledge and practical skills: promoting collaboration between those involved in education and those in technology, considering the needs of learners, and developing contents that reflect new learning styles, with emphasis on awareness of the existence of new trends. Students will be invited to articulate proposals for developing learning environments that exploit their creativity in building a new learning environment through theory and practice.\n",

        "Course Summary": "What is transculturalism? Is it similar to multiculturalism or interculturalism? For us, it paves the way to a third possibility different from them, and this course aims to bring to light the scope and the potentiality of this concept.The objective of transculturalism is not only to ensure the coexistence of cultural communities through a public recognition of their plurality. Nor does it simply consist of guaranteeing intercultural communications and compromises in order to protect the rights of citizens and to create national stability.Transculturalism pays attention primarily to the individual who cuts across cultural borders and to the meaning of her or his experiences as a human subject.Today, in this globalized world, it is a rather banal experience to encounter foreign cultures and discover others. Transcultural experience, however, is not to observe some cultures from the outside, but to experience them at once from the inside, which requires the individual to call into question her or his proper identity. As it were, because of taking root in several cultural communities through their language, one becomes aware that her or his identity is not entirely defined by her or his belonging to one of these cultures. In this sense, “tranculturation” is nothing less than ”the acquisition of a new code without losing the previous one.” (T.Todorov) Transculturalism, which is neither a shallow cosmopolitanism that ignores communal dimensions of culture, nor an unconditional praise of cultural plurality in its brightness, provides a unique domain and objective of research on human living in this world. This course investigates the meaning of transculturation given to human agents, particularly from the point of view of humanities.\n",

        "Course Summary": "While companies mostly procure funds through equity financing or bank loans, both methods do not function sufficiently in rural areas in Japan. It is difficult for rural projects to capture investments since many venture capitals invest heavily in Tokyo-based projects, while equity financing does not suit rural companies since many are not large enough to scale nation-wide and go public. As for loans, while startup support loans and loan security systems have been enhanced, regional financial institutions often hesitate to lend working capital in the following expansion stage.\n\nIn this way, opportunities to receive funds, especially high-risk funds, were restricted for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and venture businesses in rural areas, as well as social businesses aiming to resolve regional or social issues. However, recent years have seen the emergence of various social finance methods which serve as new financing sources for resolving social issues, and companies have been procuring funds through crowdfunding, social impact investments, and Hometown Tax Donations among other methods to create new businesses or expand existing ones, thereby playing a role in resolving social and regional issues. \n\nMeanwhile, much remains unknown about each social finance method, including their effective usage, demanding further research. The following questions are important from both practical and academic aspects: what kind of businesses are compatible with each financing method; and how effective is social finance relative to conventional financing methods in driving regional entrepreneurship and resolving regional issues. Let's discuss these in the classroom.\n",

The program aims to foster a realistic perspective on construction and development work by providing opportunities to visit actual construction projects in central Tokyo and directly exchange opinions with development and construction professionals working on the front lines of the projects. \n　By learning about large-scale development projects that are actually underway, students will be able to develop a clear vision of the urban development and building production that the construction industry is responsible for, by learning about the construction management work involved, the urban planning legal system, and the reality of urban redevelopment projects. The goal is to develop a clear vision of the urban development and building production that the construction industry is responsible for. \n　Specifically, students will visit each construction site, and learn based on realistic issues through question-and-answer sessions with experts in planning, design, construction, etc. involved in the project.\n",

The participants of this lecture should not be satisfied with superficially describing complex social phenomena, but through active analysis using the framework of such game theory, I want you to acquire a clear understanding of the mechanism of social phenomena and flexible thinking that excludes fixed ideas on social problems.\n",

It is used in many ways, including the visualization of complex topology and geometry, the simulation of environmental factors, the materialization of unique shapes and tectonics through digital fabrication, navigation of the vast design space that comes from algorithmic design methodology, adaptation to dynamic environments, and the interaction with human behavior through digital sensing technology.The objective of this studio is firstly to realize the practical potential of computational design methods using these technologies. Secondly it is to build a concrete skill set through a hands-on working method.\n",

The purpose of this course is to consider the relationship between architecture (and the city as an aggregate of architecture) and the environment through examples of vernacular architecture. Students will learn that there are architectures in the world that are quite different from those in Japan through examples of vernacular architecture. Students will have a broad view of the characteristics of Japanese architecture and the similarities between Japanese and foreign architecture. The aim is to broaden our perspective on architecture and cities. The students are expected to broaden their perspective on architecture and cities.\n",

Therefore, it is now economically feasible to sequence the entire genome instead of a single amplified gene to answer certain questions. In this workshop, we train students to go through the entire process of 1. Long DNA extraction and purification, 2. Nanopore sequencing, 3. Bioinformatics of genome assembly and annotation, and 4. Writing Genome Report paper for submission to international archives.\n",

        "Course Summary": "For more than half a century now, a genome has been a blueprint for the mystery of life. The genome has been treated as one of the primary information in molecular biology. Several technological innovations have drastically reduced the amount of effort spent on determining the genome sequences. Then, \"how to use it\" has become more important than observing a string of letters. At the same time, however, people have been faced with the difficulty of truly understanding the information written in the genome sequence. The genome is a blueprint, describing all the information that governs the phenomena of life. However, a great deal of further experimentation and verification is required to understand the life systems generated by the interaction of genomic elements. A separate understanding of genome information cannot help us to know the interlocking biological phenomena. This course is designed to provide a systematic introduction to the origins of genomics, the principles of genome designing biology, designable parameters, and usage of the genome. Furthermore, we will discuss and consider the issues that need to addressed to realize the genome designing biology.\n",

In spite of several problems, it becomes clear that the family business has higher profitability and capital efficiency, and invites more innovation than other businesses.They are based on the region and conduct the management in the long-term perspective.On the other hand, although Japan is a treasury of family businesses, hardly any study and education about family business has been done and the outcome is expected around the world. \n\nFrom 2009, Keio University has made an effort to create leading base for family business study and created original case materials.In this class, we will use these case materials to study family business governance, management philosophy, strategy and organization, innovation, long-life structure and the contribution to the region, and discuss how to realize the coexistence of private interest and social welfare. We will invite family business managers to deepen our knowledge about the management on site. The essay about family business management will be expected as a final assignment.\n",

The course includes lectures on the measurement principles of many experimental methods in neuroscience (methods for \"recording\" neural activity such as electroencephalography and electromyography, methods for \"stimulating\" the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, and methods for \"deducing\" neural activity that operates behind the neural activity from behavioral measurements in a computational and experimental psychological manner), as well as a lecture on how these methods are used and how they are applied in neuroscience. The lecture will also discuss how these methods have been used to understand the reality of neural communication, using two papers, which are carefully selected by the lecturers as subjects, in each class. The presenters and discussants of the papers will be assigned in rotation to promote understanding through interactions among the students. In addition, by presenting their own personal views on the impact of their research on the world in the context of the times, the lecturers will show students how to deal with academic papers. Each student will be exposed to high-impact research from a different standpoint, thereby building a foundation for the development of world-class neuroresearch.\n\nWe will have this class online by using Zoom.\n",

Thus, it is inevitable to have a considerable involvement in environmental issues, irrespective of the area of specialization. The field of environment is extremely broad. It involves a wide range of stages from the earth to life to human society. For this reason, subjects related to the environment are currently being segmented and specialized.With this context, this course helps the students to learn specialized knowledge in the field of extremely wide sectors related to environment in order to have a solid foundation of this diverse topic. A comprehensive review of a wide range of environmental fields from a unified viewpoint of science and technology is provided. This helps in deepening knowledge while viewing the entire environmental field, even if the student advances to one specific areas for his/her research or profession. In each lesson, we will take up specific cases, that can easily be understood with view point of science and technology application in the field of environmental management.\n",

The Earth system has entered a new phase in which human actions are threatening the Earth’s life support systems and drawing down the planet’s natural capital in an unsustainable manner. How could humans and social systems respond to these challenges? What are the ways to narrow the gap between global problems and international system based on nation states?\n",

        "Course Summary": "The idea of \"open design\" was born around 2010, as 3D printers and digital fabrication tools became popular and various design files were uploaded and shared on the Internet.\n\nIt is a new democratized design culture in which designers are not the authority and monopolist as in the past, but rather everyone is encouraged to \"share\" their design ideas.\n\nMore than a decade later, data for 3D printers is now in daily shared.\n\nAnd we have learned through practice that the \"open design\" approach is socially very effective in the production of assistive technology for the handicapped people, where conventional standarized design products could not reach, and in emergency manufacturing during disasters such as the Covid-19.\n\nIn this class, while learning about this history and backgrounds, students will learn through practice about a new trend called \"open source urbanism\" as a direction toward which \"open design\" will move in the next decade Specifically, students will create \"inclusive benches\" over the course of the fall semester, learning important concepts such as measurement and reproduction of existing benches, parametric design, the concept of inclusivity, and the arrangement and conversion of benches. Each week, you will be given a production assignment, so you will update your design proposal a total of five times. In the process, we will also have discussions with other students in the class about what is truly \"inclusive\" in the city.\n\nThis class is intended for students who are already able to create 3D data using 3D-CAD (fusion 360, Blender, Rhino, etc). Only those who have basic 3D skills in product design, architectural design, furniture design, etc. and have no problem communicating in English should take this class.\n\nIn addition, as a textbook for learning open design,\nOpen Design Now | Why design cannot remain exclusive\" http://opendesignnow.org/index.html\nwas published in the Netherlands in 2011, and I supervised its Japanese edition. https://opendesignnow.jp/\nI hope you will have read through the contents of this book before class.\n\n",

With this background, this class will develop lectures and workshops in cooperation with WebDINO Japan, which leads the dissemination and exploitation of open source system concepts.\n\nSpecifically, this year we will deepen our learning about interaction design and open design by putting in practice the development of embedded hardware with the theme of the future of IoT (Internet of Things) as the theme.\n",

Putting a focus on 1) language expression, 2) thoughts, 3) systems as research areas, we will analyze theoretically what these issues mean for a human subject and study practically how they can be resolved through the redesign of systems. \nAmong many challenges raised in contemporary societies, transcultural phenomenon will be an important research topic in this academic project. This phenomenon appears on an individual and a collective level, taking various forms. It can be observed in the relation between a person and his/her native language(s), or between immigrants and host societies for example. Problems raised in such a situation lead us to think seriously about how to design and construct a new relation between individuals and groups or communities.\nTo tackle this challenge, we specifically pay attention to research areas in which humanities approaches are appropriate, like literature as a form of language expression, or philosophy and thoughts. Methodologically, we investigate the meaning of the human experiences in contemporary societies and cultures from the standpoint, not of “explanation” (Erklären), but of “comprehension” (Verstehen).\nIt should be added that the social and cultural experiences mentioned above occur beyond the existing social or political frameworks because of globalization in process. This requires also rethinking of systems in order to handle the problems of language, nationality or immigration. These practical issues are also taken into account in this project. \n",

We also aim to establish a technological, economic and social ecosystem including technologies and institutions necessary to develop those functions and properties. In particular, the objective of this project is to analyze the problem solving practically using IoT and AI, and to analyze it across various sciences. Technically, intellectual edge technology for operating AI in the terminal equipment, basic technology for distributing sensor data on a large scale, and processing of multiple data streams integrally to produce highly value-added information Data analysis technology and others are targeted. Economically, when assuming the distribution of information to be produced through the market, there are mainly research methods such as the method of technically creating such a market, asymmetry of information, the price determination mechanism of information, etc. . In accordance with these issues and themes, students and faculty members belonging to different master's research societies will share the research results of each other and advance the practice of research results in society.\n",

Then explore research methodologies and research designs.\n",

In this current society where people depend on extremely complicated systems which are beyond our control, we face many problems which stem from this situation. \n　Regarding the level of anonymity the current internet society allows, and lack of awareness of murders without experience of death in people’s lives and so on, it has been long since we started to discuss the necessity of reestablishing actual relationships between ‘ourself’ and the environment around us.\n　In order to understand the tendency of putting responsibility to others in this contemporary society, and respond to the problem directly, it is necessary to understand the consciousness of the people who the problems stem from. It is necessary to comprehend your body and soul well, to know your capacity with which you can do or cannot do, to establish your own way to solve problems, and to create human relationships matching your lifestyle. \n　To aim to establish a society where people understand themselves well and understand each other, it is necessary to reconfirm how people relate to their environment by redefining their ‘body’ in any field. To understand one's own body and mind well, to know the limits of one's ability to do what one can or cannot do by oneself, to acquire one's own solutions, and to build human relationships that are suited to one's own stature. In this way, in order to build a society as a rich human group made up of people who understand themselves, it is necessary to go back to the human 'body' and re-examine the relationship between humans and the environment that surrounds them in all fields. We propose an approach to this end in the form of embodied design.\n\nIn this semester what we will focus on will be announced at the first class.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Nature Positive is a term that has been gaining attention in preparation for the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity to be held in Montreal, Canada, in December 2022, and is the concept of shifting the natural environment to a positive state, rather than trying to prevent the loss of nature. At COP10, held in Nagoya in 2010, the goal was set to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss significantly by 2020, but this goal was not achieved. The idea is to shift from a negative to a positive situation amid the critical situation of biodiversity on the planet. In addition, since climate change countermeasures and biodiversity conservation are two sides of the same global environmental issue, it is necessary to achieve both carbon neutrality and nature positivity. This academic project will discuss the realization of this nature positivity.\n",

While much research has been done on creativity in the arts, science, and product/service development, we believe that there is still room and potential for further exploration and research on small creative acts and creative activities in our daily lives and work. The purpose of this project is to promote research on such ‘creativity in everyday life.’\nParticipants will present their research and activities related to ‘creation in everyday life,’ and other participants will give feedback from their own perspectives and nurture them with love, and in some cases lead to collaboration and development. Through these activities, we will generate knowledge for the future “Creative Society” and develop people who have the ability to practice and research ‘creativity in everyday life.’\n",

If the consciousness of artificial work on the environment is the origin of architecture, it is rather natural that it is the most primitive intellectual creation act of mankind, and that it is a comprehensive and boundary existence that has corresponds with all areas. Currently, the research subjects and activity areas that architecture should deal with are dynamically expanding and merging due to various factors such as social changes, progress of computerization, and needs for coexistence with the natural environment. Today, the ability to cooperate with other fields in various aspects, from aspects such as urban development planning to devising construction technology, is necessary for a practical experience in the field of architecture, .In SFC, \"architecture\" is not fixed or dogmatic, but exists as a common item of creative and comprehensive intellectual activities across faculty members with various areas of interest. On top of that, in order to acquire the ability to carry out this on a realistic social system, the students will get review on their project of\"architecture\" that is being tackled from a different approach depending on each research theme. The purpose is to acquire the ability to expand the architectural domain and realize the fusion with new fields by exchanging it in and comprehensively verifying it from the viewpoint related to the practice of architecture.\n",

        "Course Summary": "While information technologies including Cyber Physical System (CPS), Internet/World Wide Web, and AI are evolving day by day, the environmental burden and sustainability of this technological era are becoming increasingly clear as an issue. On the other hand, in the 21st century, problems surrounding the global environment, such as climate warming, air pollution, and oceanic pollution, are becoming increasingly serious. Solving these problems is a critical issue for human society, and research for this purpose has made progress in each area. In this course, we will discuss both of these two fields, which have developed independently, and focus on a new research area that integrates them.\n\nIn this course, various technologies will be discussed from two main aspects: (a) greening and sustainability of information technology itself, and (b) technologies focusing on individual topics of environmental issues and their utilization/social implementation, and the discussion will be deepened through actual system construction.\n\nThis course will be an omnibus course, with lecturers specializing in each topic giving classes throughout the semester. The course consists of two types of lectures: lectures that are completed in one class each, and lectures and group work that are scheduled for three to four consecutive weeks.\n\nThis course willbe led by Tadashi Okoshi, along with following guest lecturers from inside and outside Keio University\n\n- Jin Mitsugi, Faculty of Environment and Information Studies, Keio University\n- Masaki Yamabe, Graduate School of Social Data Science, Hitotsubashi University\n- Jin Nakazawa, Faculty of Environment and Information Studies, Keio University\n- Shuri Marui, Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University\n- Shun Kawakubo, Department of System Design Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University\n- Kei Hiroi, Disaster Prevention Research Institute Kyoto University\n- Shoko Miyagawa, Faculty of Nursing and Medical Care, Keio University\n- Kenji Yasuoka, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University\n- Linyu Peng,Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University\n",

        "Course Summary": "Study of communication as a means to help people live healthier lives has been dynamically developing in response to social needs in many countries, while effectively incorporating new communication media and reserach methods. \"Health communication\", which will be taught inthis course will be very practical and involves dynamic approaches that can have an impact on people's health.\nFor example, today, many people with serious health issues often face multiple social, economic, and environmental challenges. In order to solve such health issues, it is not enough to simply communicate the correct knowledge (evidence) to the person in question, but it is also necessary to reach out to the people around the person in question and furthermore, to appeal the importance of the issue to policy makers and other stakeholders in order to change the social environment.\n　In the course, students will learn the basic theories and concepts of effective health and medical communication, with up-to-date examples. Guest lecturers with prominent health communication practices in Japan are also scheduled. The main areas covered in the course will be interpersonal communication, media communication, and health advocacy that can influence health and medical decision making.\nThe course is open to graduate students in the two graduate schools (Graduate School of Health Management and Graduate School of Media and Governance) who are interested in public health and health policy. Students with a great motivation to learn strategies, skills, and approaches for solvoing health problems in collaboration with multiple stakeholders are also welcomed.\n There will be two sessions per day for 7 weeks, which combines lectures, discussions and exercises to help students to aquire the day's learning effectively .\n\n",

It is essential that we introduce organisational, human, technical and physical security measures in order to properly implement the technical measures. However, it is appropriate to understand the standards necessary to achieve this purpose. This is a prerequisite for implementing and introducing various information security measures. In addition, these information security measures are not limited to those people who respond professionally in companies but also, in the current situation, where computers and networks are widely used in everyday life. It is equally important to understand the laws and systems related to information security in the current network society.\n",

        "Course Summary": "Fumihiko Maki (1928-), recipient of numerous international awards including the Pritzker Prize, is one of the world's foremost architects, universally acclaimed for his long-standing design activities and his work. He has designed not only our campus, but also many buildings at Keio University, most notably the libraries in Fujisawa, Mita, and Hiyoshi. In Japan, he has been awarded the AIJ Prize twice, and his many works include the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, Makuhari Messe, and Yokohama City Hall, but it is his international activities and reputation that deserve special mention. He has also been recognized as a practical theorist who introduced Japanese architectural thought to the world. His ideas, which place Japanese cities and their spatiality in the context of the global trend of modernism since the Edo period, have attracted worldwide attention from the perspective of the conflict between localism and globalism in the environment. His work has been highly acclaimed and has been invited to design buildings that symbolize the region and the era around the world, including the WTC site in New York, MIT Media Lab, Bihar Museum in India, Singapore Institute of Technology, the Aga Khan Foundation London Headquarters, and Shenzhen World Culture Center.\n\nKeio University SFC has received a donation from Mr. Fumihiko Maki of valuable materials such as sketches, drawings, models, photographs, manuscripts of his writings, publications, correspondence, etc., which he owned and kept in his possession, and has decided to collect, organize, store, and collect them for future use in research and educational activities both inside and outside Japan. We have decided to collect, organize, store, and collect these materials and to make them available to the public through exhibitions and data for future use in research and educational activities in Japan and abroad. The \"Fumihiko Maki Archive Room,\" located on the renovated fourth floor of the Media Center, which overlooks the entire SFC space designed by Mr. Maki, will not only display and introduce to visitors from around the world the architectural works of Mr. Maki, who has embodied the educational philosophy of Keio University, but will also serve as a historical research resource for current and former students as well as for the public. The aim is to create a digital archive that can be used not only by current students but also by people from all over the world as a historical research resource. We plan to collaborate with the Keio University Art Center, Keio Museum Commons, and the Center for Integrated Research on Digital Media and Content at Keio University in order to create multifaceted and cutting-edge digital content that goes beyond the mere creation of image data.\n\nThis class is designed to help students understand the international trend of urbanism and the historical significance of design activities through the works and footsteps of Mr. Fumihiko Maki, and at the same time, to make the creation of analytical results itself a learning opportunity as a teaching material in which elements and applicable specific knowledge that those studying architectural design should master are accumulated. The course provides a practical learning process about the philosophy of Fumihiko Maki, who advocated humanism in architecture, especially for students who aim to study and research architecture and urban design, utilizing the international trend of urbanism and the position of holding valuable materials on the works and philosophy of the architect Fumihiko Maki.\n\n",

What kind of urban future should we envision in the VUCA (Volatile・Uncertain・Complex・Ambiguous) world?\n\nThe economy and fabric of cities transform due to various factors, as do their spatial qualities. In this course, we will explore the goals of urbanization, the conditions that shape these goals, and the factors and mechanisms of real estate development. We will investigate the cause of transformations in urban economy and space, citing specific examples of real estate and investment case studies from Japan and abroad.\n\nIn addition, we will welcome a professor of MIT who teaches real estate designand a developper in the United States to discuss the future of urban development and consider the future of Japanese cities. At the same time, we will explore the possibilities of real estate design in the post-corona era, considering local values and the rise of the sharing economy.\n",
